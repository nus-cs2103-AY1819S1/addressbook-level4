= ClinicIO - Developer Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ClinicIO! +

By: `W14-1`      Since: `Sept 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

= About this guide

This guide provides an overview of ClinicIO and walks you through the installation process.
In addition, this guide provides in-depth documentation for all features and cover everything you need to know
when developing ClinicIO.

This guide assume that readers has certain developers knowledge with Java and JavaFX.

If you are new to development, you can try working step-by-step tutorial from Oracle:

- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/[Java™ Tutorials from Oracle]
- https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/jfxpub-get_started.htm[JavaFX Tutorials from Oracle]

If you are new to contributing to ClinicIO, head over to <<intro, Introduction>> to have
an overview of our project.

== Introduction

ClinicIO is a desktop app to enable you to manage a clinic with ease and efficiency. You can use ClinicIO to manage patient records, queues, medical inventory, appointments as well as view detailed statistics.

Go to the <<installation-guide, Section 2, “Installation Guide”>> to get started on install ClinicIO. +

[[installation-guide]]
== Installation Guide

This section is designed to help you to setup ClinicIO development environment.

**Prerequisites** +

Before you start setting up the project, here are the list of things that you need to install: +

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Instructions to setup the project in your computer

Follow these steps to setup ClinicIO development environment in your local computer:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

Please ensure that you verify that the project environment is able to run as expected before developing. You can verify by doing the following:

. Run the `seedu.clinicio.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

Well done. You are done setting up the project environment. Before you start developing,
here are the list of configurations that you need to make:

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `ClinicIO`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

You are now ready to start coding. You can do the following to get started:

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

This section is designed to help you to understand the overall design of ClinicIO.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the ClinicIO data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the ClinicIO data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<E>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `ClinicIO`, which `Patient` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Patient` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the ClinicIO data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.clinicio.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::queue[]
=== Queue feature
This feature allows the user to perform operations related to the queue. In particular, it provides the functionality to assign a patient into the queue, remove a patient from the queue and show the list of patients in the queue.

==== Current Implementation
The Queue feature contains several operations to indirectly manipulate the two queues underlying the `patientQueue`.
The two queues are `mainQueue` and `preferenceQueue`, both of which are hidden from the end user. To the end user, there
exists only one queue. When a patient gets assigned to the queue without any preferred doctor, the patient will be inserted into
the `mainQueue`. In the scenario where a patient has a preferred doctor, the patient will be inserted into the
`preferenceQueue`. +

When a room is available, the system will look for the first patient in the `preferenceQueue` whose preferred doctor is in the room.
It will then compare this patient with the frontmost patient from the `mainQueue` on their arrival time. The patient who arrives
earlier will get to consult the doctor. +

Both queues are composed of `java#ArrayList` as it provides richer functionalities compared to `java#Queue` to manipulate items in the list.
This allows the system to handle the situation where a patient in the middle of the queue decides to leave the queue.
In that case, the receptionist, who is the end user of ClinicIO, can simply type in a command to remove the patient from the queue. +

The implemented operations for Queue are: +

* `enqueuepatient` Command - Assigns a patient into the queue. +
* `dequeuepatient` Command - Removes a patient from anywhere in the queue. +
* `showqueue` Command - Shows a list of all patients in the queue. +

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the queue-related operations behave at each step. +

Step 1: The user lists all the patients using the `list` command. All patients in the ClinicIO record are be displayed. +

Step 2: The user executes `enqueuepatient 5` command to assign the 5th patient in the list into the queue. This patient has no preferred doctor. Now the queue has 1 patient. Underlying the queue, the patient is assigned into `mainQueue`. The `preferenceQueue` remains empty: +

image::q1.png[]

image::q2.png[]

Step 3: The user finds all patients with names `Damith` using `find Damith` command. All patients with names `Damith` in the ClinicIO record will be displayed. +

Step 4: The user executes `enqueuepatient 2` to assign the 2nd patient whose name contains `Damith` into the queue. This patient has a preferred doctor. Now the queue has 2 patients. Underlying the queue, this patient is assigned into `preferenceQueue`: +

image::q3.png[]

image::q4.png[]

Step 5: The user keeps adding patients until there are 5 patients in the queue. The `mainQueue` and `preferenceQueue` look like this: +

image::q5.png[]

The end user only sees one queue: +

image::q6.png[]

Step 6: The user lists all patients in the queue by using `showqueue` command. All patients currently waiting in the queue are displayed.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How enqueuepatient command executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Inserts the patient into one of the two underlying queues.
** Pros: Easier to implement. Slightly faster than the other alternative.
** Con: May have performance issue in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Inserts the patient into only one queue.
** Pro: Uses less memory as only one data structure is needed.
** Con: Worse time complexity than the current implementation.

===== Aspect: How dequeuepatient command executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Looks for the queue (mainQueue or preferenceQueue) from which the patient is to be removed. Then searches for the patient and removes from the queue.
** Pro: Slightly faster than the other alternative.
** Con: May have performance issue in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Naively looks for the patient in the queue, assuming Alternative 2 of `enqueuepatient` command is used (only one underlying queue).
** Pros: Uses less memory. Easy to implement as only one naive search is required.
** Con: Worse time complexity than the current implementation.

===== Aspect: How showqueue command executes

* Shows a list of patients filtered according to `Patient#isQueuing()` which is basically the queuing status of the patient.


===== Aspect: Data structures to support the queue-related commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses two ArrayLists to store the patients.
** Pros: Easier to implement. Provides more functionalities compared to Queues/LinkedList.
** Con: Uses more memory than using only one ArrayList.
* **Alternative 2:** Uses one ArrayList to store the patients.
** Pro: Uses less memory than Alternative 1.
** Con: Worse time complexity when looking for a particular patient.
* **Alternative 3: ** Uses Queue/LinkedList
** Pro: Easy to implement. Very fast operation for popping the frontmost patient.
** Con: Limited functionalities. Removing a patient from the middle of the data structure requires extra codes.
// end::queue[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `ClinicIO` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current ClinicIO state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous ClinicIO state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone ClinicIO state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial ClinicIO state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single Clinic IO state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the ClinicIO. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the ClinicIO after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted ClinicIO state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new patient. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified ClinicIO state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the ClinicIO state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous ClinicIO state, and restores the ClinicIO to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ClinicIO state, then there are no previous ClinicIO states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the ClinicIO to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest ClinicIO state, then there are no undone ClinicIO states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the ClinicIO, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all ClinicIO states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire ClinicIO.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of ClinicIO states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]


//tag::apptfeature[]
=== Appointment feature
The Appointment feature provides users the ability to schedule future appointments, view daily appointment schedules and to cancel them.

==== Current Implementation
The Appointment feature contains multiple operations to indirectly manipulate the `UniqueAppointmentList` stored within `ModelManager`.
The implemented operations include: +

* `addappt` Command - Adds appointments to the appointment schedule.
* `cancelappt` Command - Cancels appointments found within the appointment schedule.
* `listappt` Command - Lists the appointment schedule of the date specified.

Each `Appointment` object consists of a `Date`, `Time`, `Type` and `Patient`.

==== `addappt` Command

The `addappt` command behaves similarly to the `add` command used for `Patient` and `Doctor`. The command takes in the parameters required to construct `Date`, `Time` and takes in `Patient` details. Patient parameters will be simplified upon the addition of `Patient IC` in v2.0. +

The image below illustrates this process.

.Appointment construction process.
image::ApptConstructorSequenceDiagram.png[width="0"]

Once the Appointment object is constructed, `AddressBook#addAppointment(Appointment appt)` is called to add the Appointment object into the `UniqueAppointmentList`.

Before it can successfully add the `Appointment` object into the list, a check for any appointment clash is carried out via `UniqueAppointmentList#hasClash(Appointment appt)` and `UniqueAppointmentList#hasOverlap(Appointment appt)`.

Additionally, duplicates are checked for via `UniqueAppointmentList#hasAppointment(Appointment appt)`. If no exception is thrown, the Appointment is then successfully added into the `UniqueAppointmentList`.

`ModelManager#indicateAddressBookChanged()` is then called to shift the `VersionedAddressBook#pointer` to it's latest state, i.e. The addition of a new `Appointment` object.

This means that this command can be undone or redone.

==== `listappt` Command

The `listappt` command searches for appointments in the `UniqueAppointmentList` by creating a `FilteredAppointmentList` containing appointments that land on the date that was entered by the user.

A `Date` object is instantiated from the user-entered date. This is done via `ParseUtil#parseDate()`. The `date` object is then used to make a `AppointmentContainsDatePredicate` object. The list of filtered appointments by date are generated once the method `ModelManager#updateFilteredAppointmentList`. The new `FilteredAppointmentList` is finally displayed on screen with appointments chronologically ordered with their respective indices.

For example, `listappt 03 03 2018` is entered by the user. A `Date` object with data fields `Date#day`, `Date#Time`, `Date#Year` filled out as 3, 3 and 2018 respectively, is constructed. [too much create!!!]

==== `cancelappt` Command

Individual patients also contain their own specific `AppointmentHistoryList` consisting of both cancelled and finished Appointments. `cancelAppt` is the only command that directly modifies the `Patient#AppointmentHistoryList`.

==== Design Considerations

//end::apptfeature[]

// tag::medicineinventory[]
=== MedicineInventory
==== Current Implementation

The `MedicineInventory` extends `ClinicIO` with a medicine inventory. The `MedicineInventory` provides the user with an organised system to manage the medicines in the clinic.
It implements the following operations:

* `MedicineInventory#hasMedicine(MedicineName medicineName)` -- Checks if the `MedicineInventory` contains the `Medicine` with name `medicineName`.
* `MedicineInventory#addMedicine(MedicineName medicineName, Medicine newMedicine)` -- Adds `newMedicine` to the `MedicineInventory` with its `medicineName`.
* `MedicineInventory#updateMedicineQuantity(MedicineName medicineName, MedicineQuantity newQuantity)` -- Updates the `MedicineQuantity` of the `Medicine` with name `medicineName` with the `newQuantity` in the `MedicineInventory`.
* `MedicineInventory#deleteMedicine(MedicineName medicineName)` -- Deletes the `Medicine` with name `medicineName` from the `MedicineInventory`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#hasMedicine(MedicineName medicine)`, `Model#addMedicine(MedicineName medicineName, Medicine medicine)`, `Model#updateMedicine(MedicineName target, MedicineQuantity newQuantity)`, and `Model#deleteMedicine(MedicineName medicine)` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `MedicineInventory` behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the ClinicIO application. The empty `MedicineInventory` will be initialized at the same time as the `ClinicIO`.

Step 2. The user executes `addmedicine m/Paracetamol ty/tablet ed/2 ld/8 q/1000 t/take when necessary t/effects last 6 hours` command to add a new `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol` to the `MedicineInventory`. The `addmedicine` command creates a new `Medicine` `newMedicine` with the fields specified by the command and calls `Model#addMedicine(Paracetamol, newMedicine)`. This adds a new entry into `MedicineInventory`.

Step 3. The user executes `increasemedicine m/Paracetamol q/500` command to increase the current `MedicineQuantity` of the `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol` by `500` units in the `MedicineInventory`. The `increase medicine` command first calls `Model#hasMedicine(Paracetamol)` to check if the `MedicineInventory` contains a `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol`. Next, the `increasemedicine` command adds `500` to the current `MedicineQuantity`, and calls `Model#updateMedicine(Paracetamol, increasedQuantity)`. This updates the `MedicineQuantity` data attribute of the `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol` in the `MedicineInventory` with the latest quantity `increasedQuantity`.

[NOTE]
In the example outlined in Step 3, if the `Model#hasMedicine(Paracetamol)` returns false, the `MedicineInventory` does not contain a `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol`, and will not call `Model#updateMedicine(Paracetamol, increasedQuantity)`. This prevents the user from adding extra quantity to a `Medicine` that does not exist in the `MedicineInventory`.

Step 4. The user executes `decreasemedicine m/Paracetamol q/20` command to decrease the current `MedicineQuantity` of the `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol` by `20` units in the `MedicineInventory`. The `decreasemedicine` command first calls `Model#hasMedicine(Paracetamol)` to check if the `MedicineInventory` contains a `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol`. Next, the `decreasemedicine` command subtracts `20` from the current `MedicineQuantity`, and calls `Model#updateMedicine(Paracetamol, decreasedQuantity)`. This updates the `MedicineQuantity` data attribute of the `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol` in the `MedicineInventory` with the latest quantity `decreasedQuantity`.

[NOTE]
In the example outlined in Step 4, if the current value of the `MedicineQuantity` of the `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol` is less than `20`, the `MedicineInventory` does not contain enough quantity of `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol` to prescribe to the `Patient`, and will not call `Model#updateMedicine(Paracetamol, decreasedQuantity)`. This prevents the user from getting a negative value for `MedicineQuantity` of a `Medicine` in the `MedicineInventory`.

Step 5. The user executes `deletemedicine Paracetamol` command to delete the  `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol` from the `MedicineInventory`. The `deletemedicine` command calls `Model#hasMedicine(Paracetamol)` to check if the `MedicineInventory` contains a `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol`. Next, it calls `Model#deleteMedicine(Paracetamol)` to delete the `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol` from the `MedicineInventory`. Now the `MedicineInventory` is empty.

[NOTE]
In the example outlined in Step 5, if the `Model#hasMedicine(Paracetamol)` returns false, the `MedicineInventory` does not contain a `Medicine` with `MedicineName` `Paracetamol`, and will not call `Model#deleteMedicine(Paracetamol, increasedQuantity)`. This prevents the user from deleting a `Medicine` that does not exist in the `MedicineInventory`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to implement different protocols for `Medicine` with different `MedicineType` when managing the `MedicineInventory`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use one `MedicineInventory` and implement different protocols for each `MedicineType`.
** Pros: Use less memory.
** Cons: More complicated to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Use different `MedicineInventory` for each `MedicineType`.
** Pros: Use more memory.
** Cons: Easier to implement logic for commands.

==== Aspect: How to ensure that the `MedicineInventory` has sufficient `MedicineQuantity` of each `Medicine` at all times

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Design a predictive algorithm using data from `Analytics`.
** Pros: `MedicineInventory` will not have too large a surplus of un-prescribed `Medicine`.
** Cons: Logic difficult to implement, will be complicated to incorporate data from `Analytics`.
* **Alternative 2:** Maintain a fixed amount of `MedicineQuantity` for each `Medicine` in the `MedicineInventory`.
** Pros: Easier and more straightforward to implement logic.
** Cons: Might end up with too large a surplus of un-prescribed `Medicine`.
// end::medicineinventory[]

// tag::analytics[]
=== Analytics feature
The analytics feature allows users to view numerical statistics and visualizations across the various functions of a
clinic.

==== Current Implementation
The following class diagram represents the relationships between the classes in the `analytics` package.

image::AnalyticsClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The abstract `Statistics` class specified methods for the computation and retrieval of two groups of statistics. The
first group consists of statistics to be displayed as a summary while the second is for ones that are visualized. Each
of the statistics classes inherit from `Statistics`. They are encapsulated in `Analytics` which acts as a
wrapper class and employs the delegation pattern. Additionally, each of them depend on `DateTimeCount` which provides
the number of occurrences for various date and time periods.

The following operations are implemented: +

* `patientstats` Command - displays information on patients.
* `apptstats` Command - displays information on appointments.
* `doctorstats` Command - displays information on doctors.
* `medstats` command - displays information on medicines.

// tag::export[]
=== Export feature
The export feature allows users to extract patient related data out of the program, into Comma Separated Values(CSV)
format.

==== Current Implementation
The following activity diagram represents the workflow of the export functionality.

image::ExportActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `ExportPatientData` class contains `static` methods for filtering and organizing the relevant data. These methods
depend on a list of patients. It then passes the data to `ExportUtil` in order to write to a CSV file. `ExportUtil` also
checks the validity of the data to be written. The names and locations of the CSV files are predetermined by
`ExportPatientData`. All exported files are stored in the root folder of the program.

The following operations are implemented: +

* `exportpatients` Command - exports all patients' personal information into `ClinicIO_patientdata.csv`.
* `exportpatientsappointments` Command - exports all patients' appointment records into `ClinicIO_patientsappointments
.csv`.
* `exportpatientsconsultations` Command - exports all patients' consultation records into
`ClinicIO_patientsconsultations.csv`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: File format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** CSV
** Pros: Human readable. Simple schema, easy to edit manually. Supported on all target platforms. Easier to implement.
** Con: Does not allow complex relationships, resulting in repetitive data.
* **Alternative 2:** XLS (Native Excel format)
** Pros: Can store more complex relationships between data. Data can be stored in the form of charts and graphs.
** Cons: Less widely supported. Consumes more memory. More difficult to implement.

===== Aspect: File location and Naming

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Predetermined within the program to be stored in the root folder with fixed names.
** Pros: Users can easily find it as it is in the same location as the program and has a standard name. Faster
operation. Easier to implement.
** Con: Reduces flexibility, another step is required if the user needs it in another directory.
* **Alternative 2:** Specifiable by user
** Pro: Gives users more control.
** Cons: Slower operation due to time taken to enter filename and location. More difficult to implement.
// end::export[]

// tag::login[]
=== User Authentication

ClinicIO ensures appropriate user access rights are issued by authenticating users at login.

==== Current Implementation

The User Authentication feature comprises of `LoginCommand` and `LogoutCommand`.

===== `LoginCommand`

The `LoginCommand` contains multiple operations to manipulate the `UniqueStaffList` indirectly.
The implemented operations include: +

* ClinicIo#hasStaff(): Check if the staff record exists inside ClinicIO
* ClinicIo#getStaff(): Retrieve the staff record from the `UniqueStaffList`
* Password#verifyPassword(): Check if password entered by user matches the staff record that was found in the `UniqueStaffList`

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#checkStaffCredentials()`.

`HashUtil` is used to manage the encryption and verification of password.

These are operations inside `HashUtil`:

- HashUtil#hashToString(): Hash the password
- HashUtil#verifyPassword(): Check if the password matches the hashed password

Given below is a scenario to illustrate the login authentication at each step: +

Step 1: The user executes the `login` command by specifying the role, name and password. The `login` command determines the type of role entered by the user. +

Step 2: The `login` command calls `Model#hasStaff()` to ensure that this staff record exist inside ClinicIO. +

Step 3: Once ClinicIO check if staff exists, the `login` command call `Model#checkStaffCred()` to retrieve the doctor found in `UniqueStaffList`. +

Step 4: The `login` command verifies a password using `HashUtil#verifyPassword()` with the given doctor's password and password entered by the user. +

Step 5: To indicate successful completion of verification, the `login` command raises a `LoginSuccessEvent`. +

Step 6: Once verification has been made successfully, the `login` command raise an `SuccessfulLoginEvent` to indicate that a successful attempt to login has been made. +

The following sequence diagrams shows how the login works:

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes `LoginCommand`:

.Activity Diagram for the `LoginCommand`
image::LoginActivityDiagram.png[width="1080"]

===== `LogoutCommand`

The `LogoutCommand` post a `LogoutClinicIoEvent` to notify the UI that you want to log out of ClinicIO. It uses
the `EventCenter` to communicate between components without requiring the components to register with
each other explicitly.

Here is a step-by-step on how `LogoutCommand` notify `MainWindow` that you want to log out of ClinicIo: +

Step 1: The `LogoutCommand` post a new `LogoutClinicIoEvent` to the `EventsCenter`.

Step 2: The `eventBus` post the newly created `LogoutClinicIoEvent` (from Step 1) to make the event available to any listeners in `EventBus`.

Step 3: ClinicIo will listen for `handleLogoutClinicIoEvent()` to receive the event and update the user session status.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Retrieval of password

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Create a `PasswordPrefixFormatter` to handle
`CommandBox` whenever user type 'pass/' prefix.

** Pros: More secure for being able to mask password.
** Cons: Complex as it will require certain manipulation of the password in order to mask password.

* *Alternative 2*: Open an additional alert window to prompt the user for a password.

** Pros: Greater security as the entire password will be censored.
** Cons: Require a new window to be opened.
This will consume time depending on the system.
In addition, this will detract from the user experience due to the shift in focus required.

===== Aspect: Keep track of user session

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: Have a `UserSession` class to handle user session

** Pros : Allow developers to handle user session easily.
** Cons : Too troublesome as user will to login to ClinicIO at every startup.

* *Alternative 2*: Save user session state in a file.

** Pros: More convenience for users as they does not need to login on every startup.
** Cons: Less secure as users, who understand how ClinicIO works,
could edit the role of the user to have unauthorised access
to ClinicIO.

// end::login[]

// tag::patientManagement[]
=== Patient Management

ClinicIO provides a centralised patient management system to allow you to manage the clinic’s patient record more efficiently.

==== Current Implementation

The Patient Management comprises of `AddPatientCommand`, `ListPatientCommand`, `EditPatientCommand` and `DeletePatientCommand`
which is the equivalent of <<crud, Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD)>>.

===== `AddPatientCommand`

The `AddPatientCommand` add patient to the ClinicIO. `AddPatientCommand` requires the current `UserSession` to be login as a receptionist
in order to add patient.

The following code snippet shows how `AddPatientCommand` is executed:
[source,java]
----
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history)
            throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);

        if (!UserSession.isLogin()) { # <1>
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_NOT_LOGIN);
        } else if (model.hasPatient(toAdd)) { # <2>
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PATIENT);
        }

        model.addPatient(toAdd); # <3>
        model.commitClinicIo();
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, toAdd));    }
    }
----
<1> Check if user is login as receptionist
<2> Check if there is an existing patient record in ClinicIO
<3> Add patient to ClinicIO

===== `ListPatientCommand`

The `ListPatientCommand` retrieve all patients in the `UniquePatientList` by creating a FilteredAppointmentList and display all patients in the `PatientListPanel`.

===== `EditPatientCommand`

{Add implementation}

===== `DeletePatientCommand`

{Add implementation}

==== Design Considerations

// end::patientManagement[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

This section is designed for you to see how docuementation is being managed in ClinicIO.

We use https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose AsciiDoc over Markdown because AsciiDoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

You can visit <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

You can visit <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

This section is designed for you to understand
the type of testing that our project uses and ways to run our tests. +

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.clinicio.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.clinicio.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.clinicio.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.clinicio.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

This section is designed to guide you through on the Dev Ops tools and practices that is used to manage
this project. +

=== Build Automation

We use https://gradle.org/[Gradle] to perform _Build Automation_. See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== User Interface Previews
When a pull request has visual changes to the user interface (UI), you can use `git fetch upstream
pull/ID/head:NEW_BRANCH_NAME` to obtain the changes locally in a new branch and see what the UI will look like when the
pull request is merged. See https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/[local pull requests]
for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, ClinicIO depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all patients in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the ClinicIO, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the ClinicIO.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`ClinicIO`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`ClinicIO`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`ClinicIO`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`ClinicIO`]. Loop through each patient, and remove the `tag` from each patient.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your ClinicIO application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last patient in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside patient cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+
**Before**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

+
image::getting-started-ui-result-before.png[width="200"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

image::getting-started-ui-status-before.png[width="500"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the ClinicIO is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of patients when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of patients whenever there are new changes to the ClinicIO.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of patient status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of patients status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the ClinicIO to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the ClinicIO after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the ClinicIO storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the ClinicIO can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `ClinicIO`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a patient specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first patient to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first patient.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each patient later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the patient will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `clinicIo.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Patient` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsClinicIo.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Patient` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the patient that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a patient.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
