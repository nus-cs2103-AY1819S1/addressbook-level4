By: `T10-1`      Since: `Sep 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedCalendarEvent.java[`XmlAdaptedCalendarEvent.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.venue.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-title`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the calendar events data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Model,*`ModelToDo`*>>: Holds the todolist events data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same title as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete event 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete event 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteCalendarEvent.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `SchedulerChangedEvent` when the calendar data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete event 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteCalendarEventEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CalendarPanel`, `TaskListPanel`, `CalendarDisplay`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model`/`ModelToDo` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model`/`ModelToDo` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `SchedulerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` or `ModelToDo` (e.g. adding a calendar event or todolist event) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete event 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete event 1` Command
image::DeleteCalendarEventSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The Model component is handled by 2 separate classes - `Model` and `ModelToDo`

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores the calendar data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<CalendarEvent>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically update when the calendar data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

The `ModelToDo`,

* stores the todolist data
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ToDoListEvent>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically update when the todolist data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Scheduler`, which `CalendarEvent` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `CalendarEvent` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Scheduler data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the ToDoList data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::ToDoList[]
=== ToDoList feature
==== Current implementation

===== Model for ToDoList feature:
The ToDoList Model `ModelToDo` allows the `ToDoList` to store and display `ToDoListEvents`.

`ToDoListEvent` stores the relevant information for each event in the toDoList, such as the title, description and priority.

`AddToDoCommandParser` and `DeleteToDoCommandParser` functionaly have been created and allow user to add and delete `ToDoListEvent` objects.
Prefixes t/, d/ and p/ respectively allow user to input `Title`, `Description` and `Priority` for each todolist event.

Given below is an example usage scenario for adding a todolist event, and how the todolist model behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user lauches the application for the first time. The `ToDoList` is initialised to be empty.

Step 2: The user excutes `add todo t/CS3230 Assignment1 d/Dynamic Programming P/H`.

Step 3: The `AddToDoCommandParser` parsers out the strings for the title, description and priority.

Step 4: Then, `ParserUtil` checks that the input strings are valid, and uinitialises the `Title`, `Description` and `Priority`. It also checks that the `Priority` iniput is a valid priority.

Step 5: Following that, a new `ToDoListEvent` is initialised and will be displayed in the list of todo list events in the GUI.

Given below is an example usage scenario for deleting a todolist event, and how the todolist model behaves at each step.

Step 1: Make sure the todo list is not empty.

Step 2: The user executes `delete todo [index of event]` while `[index of event]` is the index number for a corresponding todolist event` displayed in `ToDoList` GUI.

Step 3: The `DeleteToDoCommandParser` parsers out the strings for the index.

Step 4: Then, `ParserUtil` checks that the input index is valid.

Step 5: Following that, the corresponding `ToDoListEvent` will be deleted and not displayed on th GUI.

The following sequece diagram shows how the add todo operation works:

image::AddToDoDeleteToDoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The delete todo does the similar operation.It calls `ModelToDo#deleteToDoListEvent`.

`ShowDescriptionParser` functionaly have been created and allow user to show description of `ToDoListEvent` objects.

Given below is an example usage scenario for showing description of a todolist event, and how the todolist model behaves at each step.

Step 1: Make sure the todo list is not empty.

Step 2: The user executes `show todo [index of event]` while `[index of event]` is the index number for a corresponding todolist event` displayed in `ToDoList` GUI.

Step 3: The `ShowDescriptionCommandParser` parsers out the strings for the index.

Step 4: Then, `ParserUtil` checks that the input index is valid.

Step 5: Following that, the corresponding description of `ToDoListEvent` will be showed and displayed by `DescriptionDisplay`.

The following sequece diagram shows how the show todo operation works:

image::ShowDescriptionSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Implementation for `list todo` is similar with `list event`.

Step 1: The user executes `list todo`.

Step 2: The `ListToDoCommand` will be executed.

Step 3: The tab will change to display todo list panel.

==== Logic for ToDoList feature:

* `Logic#getFilteredToDoListEventList` -- Returns an unmodifiable view of the filtered list of `ToDoListEvent`.
* `LogicManager#ModelToDo` -- Model for `ToDoListEvent`.

===== commands
* `Command` -- Abstract class for executing todo list.
* `Command#isToDoCommand` -- Judge the command is todo command or not.
* `Command#excute(ModelToDo, CommandHistory)` -- Execute todo command.
* `AddToDoCommand`/`DeleteToDoCommand` -- Extends `Command` for `add todo`/`delete todo` functionality.
* `ListToDoCommand` -- Extends `Command` for `list todo` functionality.
* `ShowDescriptionCommand` -- Extends `Command` for `show todo` functionality.

===== parsers
* `SchedulerParser#parserCommand` -- Add additionl parses user input into command for execution.

==== Storage for ToDoList feature:

* `ToDoListStorage` -- Represents a storage for `ToDoList`.
* `XmlAdaptedToDoListEvent` -- JAXB-friendly version of the `ToDoListEvent`.
* `XmlSerializableToDoList` -- An Immutable `ToDoList` that is serializable to XML format
* `XmlToDoListStorage` -- A class to access `ToDoList` data stored as an xml file on the hard disk.
* `Storage` -- Add Extension to `ToDoListStorage`.
* `StorageManager` -- Add `ToDoListStorage` component.

==== GUI for ToDoList feature:
The ToDoList GUI contains two parts:

* `TaskListPanel` -- Panel containing the list of `ToDoListEvent`.
* `ToDoListEventCard` -- An UI component that displays information of a `ToDoListEvent`.

In `ToDoListEventCards`, there are four components:

* `ToDoListEventCard#CheckBox` -- For check completed task.
* `ToDoListEventCard#Label(id)` -- For display index of corresponding `ToDoListEvent`.
* `ToDoListEventCard#Label(title)` -- For display title of corresponding `ToDoListEvent`.
* `ToDoListEventCard#Label(priority)` -- For display priority of corresponding `ToDoListEvent`. And different priorities will be displayed in different colors.

The description popup GUI is developed by `DescriptionDisplay`, there are two components:

* `DescriptionDisplay#TextArea(description)` -- For display description of corresponding `ToDoListEvent`.
* `DescriptionDisplay#Label(id)` -- For display index of corresponding `ToDoListEvent`.

==== Design Considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Re-construct a new model for ToDoList.

** Pros: Will not influence current functionalities for Calendar part.

** Cons: Time cost (Need to re-construct a lot of classes).

* **Alternative 2:** Modify current calendar model to support both events.

** Pros: Need less classes to re-construct.

** Cons: May cause some trouble in curent Calendar model.

Aspect: How to implement ToDoList Logic

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Modify the current `Logic` and `LogicManager`.

** Pros: Can be easily implemented and can use the current parser.

* **Alternative 2:** Re-construct a new `LogicToDo` for `ToDoList`.

** Cons: Difficult to implement in `MainApp` and other combined classes (need another `LogicToDo` object).

Aspect: How to implement ToDoList Storage

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Modify the curernt `Storage` and `StorageManager`.

** Pros: Can be easily implemented.

** Cons: Need to extends one more `ToDoListStorage`.

* **Alternative 2:** Re-construct a new `StorageToDo` for `ToDoList`.

** Pros: Will not influence current `Storage`.

** Cons: Difficult to implement in `MainApp` and other combined classes. Cause redundant work.

Aspect: How to implement ToDoList UI

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extend current GUI and left side become ToDoList GUI.

** Pros: Will be synchronous for `ToDoList` and `Calendar`.

** Cons: Need to modify current GUI.

* **Alternative 2:** Totally seperate to be 2 GUI (including two `CommandBox`).

** Pros: Don't need to change current GUI.

** Cons: Need to consruct a lot parts in GUI.
// end::ToDoList[]

// tag::fuzzysearch[]
=== Fuzzy Search and Filter by Date/Time and Tags
==== Current Implementation

===== Overview
The Fuzzy Search enhancement for the `find event` command is achieved by modifying the `Predicate` used to filter the `FilteredList` already present in the `ModelManager`, by using a fuzzy match algorithm to check the similarity of the event's `Title`, `Description` and `Venue` text with each input keywords, and seeing if it exceeds a given threshold.

The Filter by Date/Time and Tags feature is achieved by allowing the aforementioned `FilteredList` to accept multiple predicates at a time, by taking the logical AND of all the input predicates.

The feature to show the most relevant search results first is achieved by sorting the `FilteredList`, by wrapping it with a `SortedList`, and changing the `Comparator` used based on the input command.

The `FindEventCommandParser` and the `ArgumentTokenizer` were modified to accept commands that may or may not have keywords (i.e. preamble), and handle having varying numbers of prefixes in each command.

Finally, the GUI `CalendarPanel` was modified to access the new `SortedList` instead of the `FilteredList` so as to display the most relevant results first.

===== Model - Predicates, Comparators and SortedList
To allow for fuzzy matching, the `fuzzywuzzy` API was used. This allows us to compare strings using using a fuzzy algorithm based on Levenshtein distance between the strings. It assigns an integer match score from 0-100 for each pair of strings. If this score was above the threshold of 70, the retooled `FuzzySearchFilterPredicate` would allow it to be seen. This score was also used to compare events in our `FuzzySearchComparator`.

To implement the extra filters in conjunction with the fuzzy search, the `UpdateFilteredCalendarEventList` method was modified to allow for variable number (at least 1) of input `Predicate<CalendarEvent>` arguments. The method would then combine the input `Predicates` into a single `Predicate` by taking their logical AND. The combined `Predicate` would then be used to filter the `FilteredList`.

To allow users to filter by date/time, a new predicate, `DateTimePredicate` was created with 2 `DateTime` objects to set the `dateFrom` and `dateTo` for the filter. The `DateTime` objects were allowed to be null - this allowed for only 1 `DateTime` (either from or to) to be specified, so as to reduce the restrictions on users. If both `DateTime` objects were null, it would always return true - allowing it to be AND-ed with the other `Predicates` by the `ModelManager` without interfering with the filters.

To allow users to filter by tags, a new predicate, `TagsPredicate` was created. This stored a `Set` of input tag `Strings`, and if all of them had a full (but case-insensitive) match with at least one of the event's `Tags`, then the event would be shown. The `Set` is allowed to be empty - similar to the implementation of the `DatePredicate`, this case would always return true.

The existing `ModelManager` attributes and methods were insufficient to show the most relevant search results first, as this would require sorting. As a result, we created a new `FuzzySearchComparator` to sort the `CalendarEvents` based on the aforementioned fuzzy match score, in descending order. In order to let users see this, we created a new `SortedList` to the `ModelManager`, to sort the existing `FilteredList` based on the `FuzzySearchComparator`.

===== Logic - ArgumentTokenizer and Parser
The new `FindEventCommand` required modifications to the parser to allow for commands with varying levels of inputs - it could have preamble and prefixes, only preamble with no prefixes or no preamble and only prefixes. In the latter case, we noticed that the `ArgumentTokenizer` would end up capturing the initial prefix as the "preamble". In order to correctly detect the absence of a preamble, the `ArgumentTokenizer` was modified, so as to correctly detect the absence of a preamble (i.e. when a prefix is at index 0 of the input arguments), and accordingly not add the 'preamble' (actually the first prefix) to the `ArgumentMultimap`.

After modifying the `ArgumentTokenizer`, the `FindEventCommandParser` also needed to be modified to generate the correct `FindEventCommand` from the inputs. As mentioned earlier, for each of the `Predicates` and `Comparators`, we implemented a 'default case', when the `Predicate` always returned true and the `Comparator` always returned zero - e.g. when both the `DateTime` for the `DatePredicate` are null, or when the `List` of keywords for the `FuzzySearchFilterPredicate` and `FuzzySearchComparator` are empty.

This allowed us to deal with the cases where some of the inputs were missing. If the user did not enter any `tag/` prefix, then the `FindEventCommand` created by the `FindEventCommandParser` will have a `TagPredicate` containing an empty `Set` of tag strings.

===== GUI
In order for the new search features to be visible to the user, the `getFilteredAndSortedCalendarEventList` method was modified to allow the GUI `CalendarPanel` to access the `SortedList` rather than the `FilteredList` when initializing its `ListView`.

====== Tabbed Interface
Since the left panel would be shared between the `TaskListPanel` and the `CalendarPanel`, we realised that sometimes the panel would be showing the wrong list when a command is entered. Hence, after updating the `FilteredList` and `SortedList`, we made the `execute` method of the `FindEventCommand` post a `SwitchToSearchTabEvent` to the `EventsCenter`. The `MainWindow` handles the `SwitchToSearchTabEvent` and switches to the Calendar Events tab, so that the user can see the search results.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How Predicates are Managed and Applied to the FilteredList
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a simple rule (AND) to combine all the `Predicates` into a single one, then apply them to the `FilteredList` as normal.
** Pros: Easy to implement, since it mostly leverages existing functionality (only need to modify 1 method). As such it is also less likely to lead to regression errors.
** Cons: Only capable of limited functionality
* **Alternative 2:** Use a separate class to store and manage the `Predicates`, combine them in the desired fashion and apply the resulting `Predicate` to the `FilteredList`.
** Pros: Will be capable of combining multiple `Predicates` in various different ways, allowing for more complex boolean expressions (see the next section for possible implementations)
** Cons: More difficult to implement, since it would add an extra layer of integration between the new class and the ModelManager. Would also need to ensure that the list of predicates is appropriately reset when each new command is entered.

===== Aspect: How Best to Show the User the Most Relevant Search Result
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort the `FilteredList` of `CalendarEvents` in descending order of fuzzy match score
** Pros: More reliable, has high chance of achieving the desired goal
** Cons: Slower (since it needs to sort), more complicated to implement
* **Alternative 2:** Apply a more aggressive filter (with higher threshold for acceptance) to hide less relevant results
** Pros: Faster than sorting
** Cons: Can be difficult to calibrate the filters properly to achieve the desired result. May end up being too aggressive, and could remove correct/desired results in some scenarios.

==== Further Extensions

===== Additional Filters
The `FindEventCommand` could be enhanced by including more `Predicates` to further filter the events based on other properties. For instance, we could allow users to specifically filter based on whether `Venue` or `Description` matched an input keyword, e.g. `find event v/COM2` or `find event d/Wear formal clothes`.

===== Custom Filters using Boolean Logic
The `FindEventCommand` could be modified to allow users to specify custom filters using boolean logic, e.g. a possible command could be `find event t/exam && v/MPSH5` or `find event t/lecture || d/lecture`. This would allow users to perform much more fine-grained searches. It is likely to appeal to our users, since they are more tech-savvy university students who are comfortable with CLI, and thus are probably somewhat familiar with boolean logic.

In order to implement this feature, we could create a new class specifically to take in the list of input `Predicates` as well as the specific rules by which to apply the AND/OR, and then to generate the appropriate predicate based on those instructions. This could then be fed to the `ModelManager` to update the `FilteredList`.
// end::fuzzysearch[]

// tag::CalendarModel[]
=== Calendar Model
==== Implementation

The calendar model adapts the previous address book functionality to allow the `Scheduler` to store and display `CalendarEvents`.

`Person` has been refactored to `CalendarEvent`. This class stores the relevant information for each event in the
calendar, such as the title, description, start and end date/time, venue and tags.

`Title`, `Description` and `Venue` now inherit from a `TextField` parent class, to represent fields in the model that
store string data.

`DateTime` stores and validates the input start and end date/time of each event in the calendar.

`DateTimeInfo` validates that the start date/time are not after the end date/time.

`AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser` functionality have been modified to allow the creation and modification of `CalendarEvent` objects.
New prefixes d/, s/, e/ and v/ respectively allow user to input `Description`, start `DateTime`, end `DateTime`, and `Venue` for each calendar event.

Given below is an example usage scenario for adding a calendar event, and how the calendar model behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time. The `Scheduler` is initialised to be empty.

Step 2: The user executes `add t/CS2103 Tutorial d/Prepare answers to the 5 questions s/Thursday 10am e/Thursday 11am v/COM1-0210`.

Step 3: The `AddCommandParser` parses out the strings for the title, description, start and end date/time and the venue.

Step 4: Then, `ParserUtil` checks that the input strings are valid, and initialises the `Title`, `Description`, start and end `DateTime` and `Venue`. It also checks that the `DateTime` values input are valid dates and times.

Step 5: Subsequently, `AddCommandParser` calls `DateTimeInfo` to validate that the start date/time is not chronologically after the end `DateTime`, before wrapping the start and end `DateTime` in a `DateTimeInfo` object.

Step 6: Following that, a new `CalendarEvent` is initialised and will be displayed in the calendar GUI.
// end::CalendarModel[]

// tag::calendardisplay[]
=== Calendar Display

==== Implementation

===== Overview

The Calendar Display is implemented using `jfxtras.Agenda`.
`jfxtras` is a third-party library
containing more feature-rich UI controls.

===== Agenda Summary

`Agenda` defines the `Agenda.Appointment` interface, which must be
implemented for all events that it displays.
`Agenda` also defines `Agenda.AppointmentImplLocal`,
which is a bare-bones implementation
of the `Agenda.Appointment` interface.

The full documentation for `Agenda` can be found
link:http://jfxtras.org/doc/8.0/jfxtras-agenda/index.html[here].

===== Integration with our Project

`CalendarEvent` extends `Agenda.AppointmentImplLocal`,
so as to streamline the process
of displaying `CalendarEvent` s.

The `CalendarDisplay` class acts as a wrapper around `Agenda`.
`CalendarDisplay` will:

* Initialize the `Agenda` UI with the desired settings.
* Listen for changes in the list of calendar events in `Model` and
 update `Agenda` accordingly.
* Respond to the user selecting calendar events by
displaying the selected event to the user.
* Extend the in-built UI controls of `Agenda` by including functionality
to navigate the calendar.

==== Design Considerations

===== Updating the Calendar

Unlike a `ListView`, `Agenda` does not provide a way to directly set
a list of `Appointments` to be displayed.
Therefore, `CalendarDisplay` takes the list of calendar events to be displayed
and adds them to `Agenda`.
`CalendarDisplay` then listens for changes in
changes in the `Model` and forwards the same changes to `Agenda`.

===== Trimming Excess Functionality

`Agenda` provides some default functionality for responding to user
interactions with the UI, such as adding, editing and deleting `Appointment` s.
This features could have been implemented by setting the
appropriate callbacks in `Agenda`. Changes to the data in `Agenda`
could then be updated in `Model`.
However, these features would not be very useful for a product that is
designed to be used with the command line.
Their implementation would also make the data flow bi-directional, and
increase coupling between `Agenda` and `Model`.
Therefore, these functions have been disabled so as to make `Agenda`
solely for displaying the user's events as a calendar.

=== Calendar Display Navigation

==== Current Implementation

The navigation features available are:

1. View a `CalendarEvent` in the calendar display by selecting
the event. The calendar display will jump to the correct time
period and attempt to centralize the selected event.

2. View the next/previous week or using the `left` and `right`
arrow keys.

3. The user can scroll up and down the 24-hour timeline using
the `up` and `down` arrow keys, or by using the mouse scroll wheel.

==== Implementation

1. Implemented by having `CalendarDisplay` listen for
`JumpToDateTimeEvent`. `CalendarDisplay` would then
set `Agenda` to display the target date and time.

2. Implemented using an `EventFilter` in `CalendarDisplay`.
`CalendarDisplay` would then
set `Agenda` to display the target date and time.

3. In-built into `Agenda`.

==== Design considerations

===== Keyboard Navigation

Initially, the keyboard navigation features
were implemented for ease of testing `CalendarDisplay`,
with the intention to implement
Command Line Interface commands in the future.
This would agree with the project direction,
since this application is intended to be controlled
using the command line.

However, `Agenda` 's calendar display was implemented
using a customized ScrollPane, which could be scrolled using the
up and down arrow keys and the scroll wheel.
Hence, using the left and right arrow keys for
navigation felt very natural and user-friendly.

Furthermore, `Agenda` did not expose any way for the user
to scroll the calendar display programmatically.
So if the user wanted to interact with the UI,
the user would still be forced to use either the up and down
arrow keys or the scroll wheel to navigate.

Therefore, while this feature is not a CLI feature,
it was retained as a fast and easy way to navigate around
the calendar display.

=== Further Extensions

==== Command Line Navigation

To make the command line instruction set more complete, it would be
good if users are able to navigate the calendar display using the
command line as well. Some possible extensions could be:

===== View Next and Previous Week

1. User executes `view next`.

2. The command is parsed and the correct date to navigate to
is calculated. A `ChangePeriodCommand` containing the
target date is created.

3. `ChangePeriodCommand#execute` raises a JumpToDateTimeEvent.

4. `CalendarDisplay` responds by setting `Agenda` to
display the specified date and time.

===== Jump to a Specified Date

One common use case for a calendar is when the
user wants to check what events he/she has at a particular time.
An example scenario would be:

1. User executes `view 20th nov`.

2. The command is parsed, creating a `ChangePeriodCommand`
containing the target date.

3. `ChangePeriodCommand#execute` raises a JumpToDateTimeEvent.

4. `CalendarDisplay` responds by setting `Agenda` to
display the specified date and time.

// tag::parsing[]
=== SchedulerParser

==== Current Implementation

Commands are now required for both models `CalendarEvent` and `ToDoListEvent`. Hence it is beneficial for the parser to
support both one and two-worded commands which would specify the action (e.g. `add`, `delete`) as well as the model
it is updating (`event` or `todo`). The parser still retains the responsibility of resolving which `Command` should
be returned, for both models.

==== Design Considerations

The parser should be flexible enough to at least support commands which are identified by one word and those
identified by two words. Some commands such as `help` and `exit` are not specific to a model, while others act on one
 of the two models and are hence appropriately identified by another word.

One other alternative is to keep the commands to one word and split these words by a delimiter such as a dash (`-`) e
.g. `add-event`. However this is assumed to be less natural to the end user.
// end::parsing[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedScheduler`.
It extends `Scheduler` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `SchedulerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedScheduler#commit()` -- Saves the current venue book state in its history.
* `VersionedScheduler#undo()` -- Restores the previous venue book state from its history.
* `VersionedScheduler#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone venue book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitScheduler()`, `Model#undoScheduler()` and `Model#redoScheduler()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial
Scheduler state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that
single Scheduler state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete event 5` command to delete the 5th CalendarEvent in the Scheduler. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitScheduler()`, causing the modified state of the Scheduler after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `schedulerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Scheduler state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add t/CS2103 Lecture ...` to add a new CalendarEvent. The `add event` command also calls `Model#commitScheduler()`, causing another modified Scheduler state to be saved into the `schedulerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitScheduler()`, so the Scheduler state will not be saved into the `schedulerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the CalendarEvent was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoScheduler()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Scheduler state, and restores the Scheduler to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Scheduler state, then there are no previous Scheduler states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoScheduler()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoScheduler()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the Scheduler to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `schedulerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Scheduler state, then there are no undone Scheduler states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoScheduler()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list event`. Commands that do not modify the Scehduler, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitScheduler()`, `Model#undoScheduler()` or `Model#redoScheduler()`. Thus, the `schedulerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear calendar`, which calls `Model#commitScheduler()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `schedulerStateList`, all venue book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/CS2103 Lecture ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire venue book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the calendarEvent being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of venue book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App title, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).


== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.venue.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.venue.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.venue.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.venue.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all calendarEvents in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the venue book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the venue book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/calendarEvent/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a calendarEvent, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/calendarEvent/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each calendarEvent, and remove the `tag` from each calendarEvent.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your venue book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last calendarEvent in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside calendarEvent cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the venue book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of calendarEvents when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of calendarEvents whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save venue and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of calendarEvents status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the venue book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the venue book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the venue book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the venue book can be saved in a fixed temporary venue.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a calendarEvent specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first calendarEvent to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first calendarEvent.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/venue/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/venue/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each calendarEvent later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/calendarEvent/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/calendarEvent/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/calendarEvent/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/calendarEvent/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the calendarEvent will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `scheduler.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsScheduler.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/venue/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/model/calendarEvent/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/venue/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the calendarEvent that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/venue/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/venue/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/venue/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a calendarEvent.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
