By: `Team W17-2`      Since: `Sep 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/modsuni/storage/XmlAdaptedCredential.java[`XmlAdaptedCredential.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/modsuni/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/modsuni/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/modsuni/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.modsuni.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the Coding Style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating Documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the modsUni branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-2/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-2/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting Up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting Started with Coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/modsuni/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven Nature of the Design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the register command.

.Component interactions for `register` command (part 1)
image::SDforRegisterCommandOverview.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `register` command (part 2)
image::SDforRegisterCommandPart2.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/modsuni/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/modsuni/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/modsuni/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ModsUniParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model Component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/modsuni/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage Component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/modsuni/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.modsuni.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::useraccountmanagement[]
=== User Account Management

User Account Management involves mainly the authentication process of the users.
Only once they are authenticated, will their respective user data be loaded into the application.
Additionally, it is only by registering/logging in will users be able to access and manipulate their account details. +
This section will describe in detail the Current Implementation and the Design Considerations of the User Account Management feature. +

Figure 1(shown below) describes the general flow of the user account management in an activity diagram.

image::ADforUserAccountManagement.png[width="800",align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Figure 1. Activity Diagram for User Account Management._

==== Current Implementation

The User Account Management mechanism is facilitated by the following classes:

* `Credential` +
It stores `Username` and `Password` of the `User` class. +
Additionally, it implements the following operation(s):

** `Credential#isSameCredential(...)` -- Determines if there already exists a `Credential` with the same username in the `CredentialStore`

* `CredentialStore` +
It stores the credentials and the corresponding username in a `HashMap` object. +
Additionally, it implements the following operations(s):

** `CredentialStore#addCredential(...)` -- Adds the input credential into the credential store
** `CredentialStore#removeCredential(...)` -- Removes the input credential from the credential store.
** `CredentialStore#isVerifiedCredential(...)` -- Checks if there exists the same credential with the matching username and passwords. Returns `true` if the input credential is verified.

[NOTE]
The above operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addCredential()`, `Model#removeCredential()` and `Model#isVerifiedCredential()` respectively.

* `User` +
Contains all the necessary data contained within a single user. +
Currently, there are two Users, each defined by their `Roles`; namely `Student` and `Admin` as defined in the enum class `Role.java`

*** `Student` +
Refers to the majority of the users. It stores variables pertaining to a student user.

*** `Admin` +
Refers to the application managers. It stores variables pertaining to an administrator.

Figure 2(shown below) is the Class Diagrams illustrating the inheritance between `User`, `Student` and `Admin`

image::UserClassDiagram.png[width="500",align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Figure 2. User, Student and Admin Class Diagrams_

[NOTE]
Each User types contain different class-variables. Additionally, the sets of commands available for either `User` types are limited to their respective `Role`

===== Implementation of the register feature

The `register` feature is facilitated by the `RegisterCommand` class.
It allows for students to sign up for a modsUni account, which is required to use the application.

[NOTE]
Registering only applies to students. For the creation of `Admin` Accounts, only existing administrators can create another `Admin` account

The `RegisterCommand` extends the `Command` class. Figure 3(shown below) depicts the UML representation of the `RegisterCommand`. +

image::RegisterCommandUML.png[width="350",align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Figure 3. UML Diagram of `RegisterCommand`._

Parsing of command is performed by `RegisterCommandParser`,
which returns a `RegisterCommand` object after parsing Username, Password, Name, Path to Profile Picture, Enrollment Date, Major(s) and Minor(s).
The Sequence Diagram shown below in Figure 4 illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` & `Model` components when the `RegisterCommand` is being executed.

image::SDforRegisterCommandLogicAndModel.png[width="900",align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Figure 4. Sequence Diagram for the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` Components when executing `RegisterCommand`._

Figure 5 below shows the high-level sequence diagram of the command execution.

image::SDforRegisterCommandOverview.png[width="800",align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Figure 5. High-Level Sequence diagram of registering a new student account._

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the register mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. At start up, the `currentUser` in `Model` is not yet instantiated,
this would prevent any commands aside from `register` and `login` to be available to the user. +

[NOTE]
`currentUser` refers to the user account currently loaded in the modsUni Application.

Step 2. The user executes `register user/demo ...` to register a new `Student` account.
The `register` command will call `Model#addCredential(...)` and `Model#setCurrentUser(...)`. +

[NOTE]
A new `Student` would be initialized and automatically set as the `currentUser`, enabling the user to perform additional commands automatically. +


===== Implementation of the login feature

The `login` feature is facilitated by the `LoginCommand` class.
It allows for students to log into their existing modsUni account, granting them access to their respective user data. +

The `LoginCommand` extends the `Command` class. Figure 1(shown below) depicts the UML representation of the `LoginCommand`. +

image::LoginCommandUML.png[width="350",align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Figure 1. UML Diagram of `LoginCommand`._

Parsing of command is performed by `LoginCommandParser`, which returns a `LoginCommand` after parsing the username and password inputs.
The Sequence Diagram shown below in Figure 2 illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` & `Model` components when the `LoginCommand` is being executed.

image::SDforLoginCommandLogicAndModel.png[width="900",align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Figure 2. Sequence Diagram for the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` Components when executing `LoginCommand`._

Figure 3 below shows the high-level sequence diagram of the command execution.

image::SDforLoginCommandOverview.png[width="800",align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Figure 3. High-Level Sequence Diagram of the login process._

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the login mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user launches the application. As explained earlier, since the `currentUser` in `Model` is not yet instantiated,
the user will only be able to execute either the `register` or `login` command. +

2. Having already registered an account, the user can proceed to execute `login user/demo pass/#Qwerty123` to log in to their account.
The `login` command will call `Model#isVerifiedCredential(...)` to determine if the user input matches a credential in `CredentialStore`. +

3. Should the credential be valid and verified, a `User` will be loaded from a the default `userData.xml` file.
Subseqently, the `Model#setCurrentUser(...)` will be called to set the loaded user data as the `currentUser`. +

4. Should the credential not be valid or does not match an existing credential in the `CredentialStore`, the user will simply be shown a failure message.

===== Implementation of the edit feature

The `edit` feature is facilitated by the `EditStudentCommand` class.
It allows for students to edit their existing modsUni account, granting them the ability
to modify personal details. +

The `EditStudentCommand` extends the `Command` class. Figure 1(shown below) depicts the UML representation of the `EditStudentCommand`. +

image::EditStudentCommandUML.png[width="350",align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Figure 1. UML Diagram of `EditStudentCommand`._

Parsing the command is performed by `EditStudentCommandParser`, which returns a `EditCommand` after parsing the user input.
The Sequence Diagram shown below in Figure 2 illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` & `Model` components when the `EditStudentCommand` is being executed.

image::SDforEditStudentCommandLogicAndModel.png[width="900",align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Figure 2. Sequence Diagram for the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` Components when executing `EditStudentCommand`._

Figure 3 below shows the high-level sequence diagram of the command execution:

image::SDforEditStudentCommand.png[width="800",align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Figure 3. High-Level Sequence Diagram of the edit process._

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user launches the application. Depending on whether the user already has an account registered, he would proceed to login. +
2. Now that the `currentUser` is being loaded. The student can proceed to execute an edit command `edit n/demo enroll/03/08/2017` +
At this point,`ModsUniParser` would instantiate `EditStudentCommandParser` which would parse the `edit` command.
3. `EditStudentCommandParser` would instantiate `EditStudentDescriptor`. `EditStudentDescriptor` contains the respective user details that is provided in the user input. +
[NOTE]
`EditStudentDescriptor` contains *only* the details as provided in the user input and will be used in `EditCommand#execute()` to update `currentUser`

4. `EditStudentCommandParser` would return a `EditCommand` with the descriptor class. Subsequently, `EditCommand#execute()` would be called.
5. At this point, `EditCommand#createEditedStudent(...)` would be called constructing a new Student object, with the `currentUser` and the descriptor.
6. Finally, `Model#setCurrentUser(...)` would be called to update `currentUser` with the new details.
[NOTE]
Upon the successful execute of the `edit` command, `UserTab` would also be updated with the new user details.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How user credentials are stored.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Usage of a separate `CredentialStore` class to store all user credentials.
** Pros: This allows for better security through abstraction. By having the user credentials stored away from the `User`, they(users & malicious attackers) will not be able to explicitly manipulate the secured data outside the given parameters.
** Cons: Additional memory resources is used to store the data structures.
* **Alternative 2:** Storing the user credentials within the `User` class.
** Pros: This alternative is easier to implement.
** Cons: Sacrifices security for ease of implementation.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the user account features.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A `HashMap` is used to store the credentials, using a username-credential(`String->Credential`) key-value pair.
** Pros: Considering that there is no possibility of duplicate usernames, utilizing a `HashMap` data structure would improve optimization when verifying a specific credential, with an _O(1)_ search time.
** Cons: Additional memory resources is required for the usage of complex data structures.
* **Alternative 2:** Using a `List` of Credentials
** Pros: Will require less memory resources. Additionally, it is easier to implement.
** Cons: Should more and more user adopt the application, the increased volume of user credentials would result in an _O(n)_ operation when verifying a user credential.
// end::useraccountmanagement[]

// tag::generate[]
=== Generate Schedule Feature

This feature is for student users to generate a schedule containing the modules to take in each semester
during their entire university candidature. It is executed using the `generate` command.

[NOTE]
The `generate` command can only be executed by users of type `Student`.

The section below will describe in detail the current implementation and design considerations of the
`generate` command.

==== Current Implementation
The sequence diagram shown below in Figure 1 illustrates the interactions between some of these components
 when the command is executed.

image::SequenceDiagramforGenerate.png[width="200]
_Figure 1. High Level Sequence Diagram for `generate` command_

The command is facilitated by the following classes:

* `Generate` command class +
The `Generate` command class extends from the `Command` class. Figure 2 below depicts the UML
diagram for the `Generate` command class.

+
image::GenerateCommandUML.png[width="400"]
_Figure 2. Generate command UML Diagram_

* `Model` class +
The following methods in the `Model` class are used in this command:

** `isStudent()` +
This method checks if the current user is a student.
** `canGenerate()` +
This method checks if it is possible to generate a schedule.
** `generateSchedule()` +
This method generates a schedule.

* `Generate` from the `Logic` package. +
This class is used to encapsulate the processes for generating a schedule. The following methods are used
in this command: +
** `canGenerate(Student)` +
This methods checks if all the module prerequisites from the student's staged list is met. It does this by
merging the staged and taken module list together. +
Using the merged list, it extracts out the list of module codes. Each module in the staged list is checked
to see if the prerequisite condition can be met. The following code snippet shows this process:
+
[source, java]
----
public static Optional<List<Code>> canGenerate(Student student) {
    List<Code> cannotTakeCode = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Code> codeChecklist = student.getTakenAndStageCode();
    UniqueModuleList modulesStaged = student.getModulesStaged();
    for (Module module : modulesStaged) {
        if (!module.checkPrereq(codeChecklist)) {
            cannotTakeCode.add(module.getCode());
        }
    }
    // return list of codes that failed to met prerequisite condition or an empty value if the list is empty.
}
----
** `generateSchedule()` +
This method will create a schedule using modules that are in the student's staged list. +
It does this by going though the list of modules and removing those that satisfies the prerequisite condition. As it removes,
the module code is added to a temporary list. This list is used during the checking of prerequisite
conditions for the remaining modules. +
The following code snippet will provide a clearer explanation of how the method works:
+
[source, java]
----
public SemesterList generateSchedule() {
    SemesterList semesterList = new SemesterList();
    Semester newSemester = new Semester();

    List<Code> taken = new ArrayList<>();

    while (modulesStaged.size() > 0) {
        for (Module element : modulesStaged) {
            if (element.checkPrereq(taken)) {
                // Remove module from staged list
                // Add module to semester and temporary list
            }
        }

        semesterList.addSemester(newSemester);
        newSemester = new Semester();
    }
    return semesterList;
}
----

[NOTE]
This class is different from the `Generate` command class. The command class is for the execution of the
command, while the current one is for creating the schedule.

===== Execution phase of the `generate` command
Figure 3 below shows an overview of the steps performed during the execution phase of the command.

image::SDforGenerateCommandLogicAndModel.png[width="250]
_Figure 3. Sequence diagram for the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` Components when executing
 `generate`._

In the execute method of the command, the following checks are performed:

. Type of user account +
This step checks if a user has logged in and the current user is a student. It is performed as only student
accounts are able to generate a schedule.

. Modules in staged list +
This step ensures that there modules are available to add into the schedule.

. Staged modules prerequisites +
This step verifies that the prerequisites for all modules in the staged list are met. It is done to ensure
 that it is possible to generate a schedule.

If any of the checks fails, an error will be thrown. The following code snippet illustrates the
checking process: +
[source, java]
----
if (model.getCurrentUser() == null) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_ERROR);
}

if (!model.isStudent()) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_INVALID_ROLE);
}

if (!currentStudent.hasModuleToTake()) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_NO_MODULES);
}

if (cannotTakeCodes.isPresent()) {
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_FAILURE + cannotTakeCodes.toString());
}
----
After passing all the checks, the command will proceed on and generate a schedule. To display the schedule
in the user interface, two events will be created.

. `MainWindowClearResourceEvent` +
It is created to inform the current panel in the main window to clear it's resources.
. `NewGenerateResultAvailableEvent` +
This event will show the generated schedule in the main window.

These events will be sent to `EventsCenter` to process and execute it.

===== Example scenario of the generate command
Given below is an example usage scenario of how the generate command behaves:

The user launches the application for the first time and the `currentUser` will at this point be `null`.
Issuing the generate command at this point will throw an error message indicating to the user that they have
not registered an account or they are currently not logged in.

In order to utilise the generate command, the user must perform one of the following options:

* The user executes `register user/demo ...` to register a new `Student` account, followed by `addModuleS
cs1010`.

* The user executes `login user/demo pass/P@ssw0rd userdata/saveFile.xml` to log into account, followed by
`addModuleS cs1010`.

[NOTE]
A new `Student` would be initialized and automatically set as the `currentUser`. The module cs1010 would
also be added to the student's staged module list, enabling the student to perform generate command. +

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Placement of methods for generating a schedule
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a separate `Generate` class in the `Logic` package to
encapsulate the processes for generating a schedule.
** Pros: Modification made to the generating of schedule does not affect the `Student` model.
** Cons: This approach adds complexity to the design of the application.
* **Alternative 2:** Adding the logic for generating the schedule to the `Student` model.
** Pros: This alternative is easier to implement.
** Cons: It breaks the single responsibility principle of the `Student` model.

===== Aspect: Checking of prerequisites before generating a schedule
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Perform checks to ensure that all prerequisites for modules in staged
 list are fulfilled.
 ** Pros: Ensures that the command will not cause an infinite loop.
 ** Cons: The command will not always be able to generate a schedule as students may forget to add in the
 prerequisite modules.
* **Alterative 2:** Assume that prerequisites for all modules are met.
** Pros: Reduces the time complexity of the command.
** Cons: The command might end up with an infinite loop as it keeps on trying to arrange the modules.
// end::generate[]

// tag::usermodulemanagement1[]
=== User Module Management
User Module Management involves mainly the interaction between users and their module lists.
A user is able to add and remove the module only if he is a student and the module exists in the database.
A user is allowed to search a module in the database.

The section below will describe in detail the Current Implementation and the Design Considerations of the User Module Management.

==== Current Implementation

The User Module Management is facilitated by the following classes:

* `Module` +
It stores all the necessary data contained within a single module.
The `code` of a module is considered as a key for searching and comparing purpose.
Two modules with the same `code` is considered as the same module.

* `ModuleList` +
It stores a `UniqueModuleList` which stores modules with unique code.

** `UniqueModuleList` stores an internal `ObservableList` for UI purpose.

* `User` +
It is the actor of the command. Add and remove commands are limited to a user whose `Roles` is `Student`.

** `Student` stores two `ModuleList` namely `modulesTaken` and `modulesStaged`, to store the modules chosen by the student.
*** `modulesTaken` represents the module student has taken before.
*** `modulesStaged` represents the module student is intending to take.

===== Implementation of the add feature

The `add` feature is facilitated by the `AddModuleToStudentStagedCommand` and `AddModuleToStudentTakenCommand` class.
It allows a user to add modules to his staged/taken module list by giving their code.

[NOTE]
A user is allowed to add only if: +
the user has logged in +
the user is a student +
the module exists in the database at this moment +
both staged and taken module list do not contain the module already

`AddModuleToStudentStaged/TakenCommand` extends the `Command` class. Figure 1(shown below) depicts the UML representation of `AddModuleToStudentStaged/TakenCommand`.

image::AddModuleToStudentStagedTakenCommandUML.png[width="400"]
_Figure 1. UML Diagram of `AddModuleToStudentStaged/TakenCommand`._

Parsing of command is performed by `AddModuleToStudentStaged/TakenCommandParser`,
which returns a `AddModuleToStudentStaged/TakenCommand` object after parsing input.

The Sequence Diagram shown below in Figure 2 illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` & `Model` components when `AddModuleToStudentStaged/TakenCommand` is being executed.

image::SDforAddModuleToStudentStagedTakenCommandLogicAndModel.png[width="900"]
_Figure 2. Sequence Diagram for the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` Components when executing `AddModuleToStudentStaged/TakenCommand`._

Figure 3 below shows the high-level sequence diagram of the command execution.

image::SDforAddModuleToStudentStagedTakenCommandOverview.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3. High-Level Sequence Diagram of adding a new module to the student's staged/taken module list._

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the adding mechanism behaves at each step: +
Step 1. The user launches the application. +
If it is the first time the user uses the application, after login as a student,
a `Student` model will be created, then `modulesTaken` and `modulesStaged` will be initialized as an empty `ModuleList`. +
If the user has logged in before, after login as a student, `modulesTaken` and `modulesStaged` will be recovered to the last saved version.

Step 2. After the user enters the command, `AddModuleToStudentStaged/TakenCommandParser` will create a `AddModuleToStudentStaged/TakenCommand`,
which contains two parameters. +
The first parameter is an `ArrayList` of `Code` to be searched. +
The second is a `String` contains the duplicate code entered by user.

Step 3. When the command is executed, `AddModuleToStudentStaged/TakenCommand` will call `Model#getCurrentUser()` and `Model#isStudent()` to check whether the user is a `Student`. +
`Model#searchCodeInDatabase(...)` to check whether the module exists in the database and update `toAdd` to the searched module,
`Model#hasModuleStaged(...)` and `Model#hasModuleTaken(...)` to check whether the module has already existed in the student's staged or taken module list,
`Model#addModuleStaged/Taken(...)` to finally add the module to the student's staged/taken module list.

Step 4. After the module is added, the command will post a `ShowStaged/TakenTabRequestEvent` to show the user updated staged/taken module list. +
A `CommandResult` containing the log of execution result will be returned.

===== Implementation of the remove feature
The `remove` feature is facilitated by the `RemoveModuleFromStudentStagedCommand` and `RemoveModuleFromStudentTakenCommand` class.
It allows a user to remove modules from his staged/taken module list by giving their code.
[NOTE]
A user is allowed to remove only if: +
the user has logged in +
the user is a student +
the module exists in the database at this moment +
his staged/taken module list contains the module need to be removed

The implementation of `remove` feature is similar to `add` feature. They have generally the same mechanism, except remove
command only use `Model#hasModuleStaged/Taken(...)` to ensure the respective module list contains the module, while add
command use both methods to ensure the ensure does not exist in neither module list. See Step 3 of the adding mechanism for reference.

// end::usermodulemanagement1[]
===== Implementation of the search feature
The `search` feature is facilitated by the `SearchCommand` class.
It allows a user to search modules in the database using one or several prefixes.
[NOTE]
The command does not require user to login or register.

[NOTE]
The command does not support using a substring for searching. +
Eg. `search 1010` can not being used for searching "CS1010"

[NOTE]
The command only supports to search within database module list. +
The design consideration is that it does not make sense to search staged or taken module list
as the scale of these two lists tend to be small.

`SearchCommand` extends the `Command` class. Figure 4(shown below) depicts the UML representation of `SearchModule`.

image::SearchCommandUML.png[width="400"]
_Figure 4. UML Diagram of `SearchCommand`._

The Sequence Diagram shown below in Figure 5 illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` & `Model` components when `SearchCommand` is being executed.

image::SDforSearchCommandLogicAndModel.png[width="900"]
_Figure 5. Sequence Diagram for the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` Components when executing `SearchCommand`._

Figure 6 below shows the high-level sequence diagram of the command execution.

image::SDforSearchCommandOverview.png[width="800"]
_Figure 6. High-Level Sequence Diagram of search modules in database module list._

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the searching mechanism behaves at each step: +
Step 1. User enters the command, then `ModsUniParser` will handle it and create a `SearchCommandPraser`.
`SearchCommandPraser` will use `CodeStartsKeywordsPredicate` to create a `predicate`. `SearchCommandPraser` then will
use the `predicate` as a parameter to create a `SearchCommand`.

Step 2. When the command is executed, `SearchCommand` will call `Model#updateFilteredDatabaseModuleList(...)` to use
the `predicate` to filter `filteredDatabaseModules`. UI of `DatabaseModuleListPanel` will change accordingly.

Step 3. The command will  post a `DatabaseTabRequestEvent` to show the user updated database module list. +
A `CommandResult` containing the execution result will be returned.

// tag::usermodulemanagement2[]
==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to search database using Code

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `Code` as a key to search `moduleList` one by one.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Do not need to refactor `moduleList` to support this feature.
** Cons: Efficiency of searching is low. The time complexity is `O(N)`.
* **Alternative 2:** Refactor `moduleList` to be a `HashMap` for searching.
** Pros: Efficiency of searching will increase. The time complexity is `O(1)`.
** Cons: May not be cost-efficient to refactor `moduleList` only to support this feature.

=== Module Database Administration

Module database administration is a series of commands that administrators can use to make necessary changes to keep
the module database up to date, or to cater to their own needs.

[NOTE]
The commands pertaining to module database administration can only be executed by users of type `Admin`.

Administrators can choose to add, remove or edit a module using `addModuleDB`, `removeModuleDB` and `editModule` respectively.
The changes will then be reflected
in both the module list in memory and in storage. Figure 1(shown below) describes the general flow of the administration
of the module database in an activity diagram.

image::ADforModuleDatabaseAdministration.png[width="800]
_Figure 1. Activity diagram for module database administration._
// end::moduledatabaseadministration1[]

==== Current Implementation

The Module database administration mechanism is facilitated by `ModuleList` in `Model` via the following operations:

* `ModuleList#addModule(...)` -- This method adds a module to the module list.
* `ModuleList#removeModule(...)` -- This method removes a module from the module list.
* `ModuleList#hasModule(...)` -- This method checks if the given module already exists.
* `ModuleList#updateModule(...)` -- This method replace the specified target module with the given edited module.

[NOTE]
These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addModuleToDatabase(...)`,
`Model#removeModuleFromDatabase(...)`, `Model#hasModuleInDatabase(...)` and `Model#updateModule(...)` respectively.

Each module database administration commands is facilitated by a command class in modsUni. The following list
illustrates each command and their respective command class:

* `addModuleDB` -- `AddModuleToDatabaseCommand`
* `removeModuleDB` -- `RemoveModuleFromDatabaseCommand`
* `editModule` -- `EditModuleCommand`

// tag::moduledatabaseadministration2[]
**Adding module to database**

`addModuleDB` mechanism is facilitated by `AddModuleToDatabaseCommand`. It allows the addition of modules to database.

The `AddModuleToDatabaseCommand` extends for `Command`. Figure 2(shown below) depicts the UML representation of the
`AddModuleToDatabaseCommand`.

image::AddModuleToDatabaseCommandUML.png[width="300"]
_Figure 2. UML diagram of `AddModuleToDatabaseCommand`._

Parsing of command is performed by `AddModuleToDatabaseCommandParser`, which returns a `AddModuleToDatabaseCommand`
object after parsing ModuleCode, Title, Credit, Department, Description, AvailableSem and Prereq. Figure 3(shown below)
 shows the
sequence diagram of the `AddModuleToDatabaseCommandParser`.

image::SDforAddModuleToDatabaseCommandLogicAndModel.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3. Sequence diagram for the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` Components when executing
`AddModuleToDatabaseCommand`._

Figure 4(shown below) shows the high-level sequence diagram of the command execution.

image::SDforAddModuleToDatabaseCommand.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4. High-Level Sequence diagram of adding a module to database._

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `addModuleDB` mechanism behaves at each step:

[NOTE]
For this example usage scenario, we assume that module "CS2109" did not exist in the database initially.

. An admin executes `addAdminDB` with valid arguments to add a module with module code “CS2109” to the module list.
The `addModuleDB` command calls `Model#addModuleToDatabase(...)`, causing the new model to be added to `ModuleList`
and subsequently update the `moduleList.xml` file with the new list.

. Another admin did not know the new module has already been added and tries to add the “CS2109” again by executing
`addModuleDB`. The `addModuleDB` command calls `Model#hasModuleInDatabase(...)`, causing a feedback to return,
informing the admin that the module already exists, and the module is not added.

The code snippet below shows how user input is parsed into a `AddModuleToDatabaseCommand` object.
[source, java]
----
    public AddModuleToDatabaseCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        ArgumentMultimap argMultimap =
                ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_MODULE_CODE, PREFIX_MODULE_DEPARTMENT, PREFIX_MODULE_TITLE,
                        PREFIX_MODULE_DESCRIPTION, PREFIX_MODULE_CREDIT, PREFIX_MODULE_AVAILABLE, PREFIX_MODULE_PREREQ);

        if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_MODULE_CODE, PREFIX_MODULE_DEPARTMENT, PREFIX_MODULE_TITLE,
                PREFIX_MODULE_DESCRIPTION, PREFIX_MODULE_CREDIT, PREFIX_MODULE_AVAILABLE, PREFIX_MODULE_PREREQ)
            || !argMultimap.getPreamble().isEmpty()) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT,
                    AddModuleToDatabaseCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }

        String codeName = argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_MODULE_CODE).get();
        Code code = new Code(codeName);
        String department = argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_MODULE_DEPARTMENT).get();
        String title = argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_MODULE_TITLE).get();
        String description = argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_MODULE_DESCRIPTION).get();
        int credit = Integer.parseInt(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_MODULE_CREDIT).get());
        boolean[] sems = getAvailableSems(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_MODULE_AVAILABLE).get());
        Prereq prereq = ParserUtil.parsePrereq(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_MODULE_PREREQ).get());

        Module module = new Module(code, department, title, description, credit,
                sems[0], sems[1], sems[2], sems[3], new ArrayList<Code>(), prereq);

        return new AddModuleToDatabaseCommand(module);
    }
----

The created `Command` object then execute the command, shown in the code snippet below.
[source, java]
----
    public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        if (model.getCurrentUser() == null) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_NOT_LOGGED_IN);
        }

        if (!model.isAdmin()) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_NOT_ADMIN);
        }

        if (model.hasModuleInDatabase(toAdd)) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_MODULE);
        }

        model.addModuleToDatabase(toAdd);

        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS));
    }
----
// end::moduledatabaseadministration2[]

// tag::moduledatabaseadministration3[]
**Deleting module from database**

`removeModuleDB` mechanism is facilitated by the `RemoveModuleFromDatabaseCommand` class. It allows `Admin` to remove
`Module` from the database.

The `RemoveModuleFromDatabaseCommand` extends for `Command`. Figure 5(shown below) depicts the UML representation of the
`RemoveModuleFromDatabaseCommand`.

image::RemoveModuleFromDatabaseCommandUML.png[width="300"]
_Figure 5. UML diagram of `RemoveModuleFromDatabaseCommand`._

Parsing of command is performed by `RemoveModuleFromDatabaseParser`, which returns a `RemoveModuleFromDatabase` object
after parsing moduleCode object. Figure 6(shown below) shows the sequence diagram of the `RemoveModuleFromDatabaseCommandParser`.

image::SDforRemoveModuleFromDatabaseCommandLogicAndModel.png[width="800"]
_Figure 6. Sequence diagram for the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` Components when executing
`RemoveModuleFromDatabase`._

Figure 7(shown below) shows the high-level sequence diagram of the command execution.

image::SDforRemoveModuleFromDatabaseCommand.png[width="800"]
_Figure 7. High-Level sequence diagram of removing a module from database._

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `removeModuleDB` mechanism behaves at each step:

[NOTE]
For this example usage scenario, we assume that module "CS2109" already existed.

. An admin executes `removeAdminDB CS2109` to remove the module with module code “CS2109” from the module list.
The `removeModuleDB` command calls `Model#removeModuleFromDatabase(...)`, causing the module with module code “CS2109”
to be removed from the module list and subsequently update the `moduleList.xml` file with the new list.

. Another admin did not know that module “CS2109” has already been removed and tries to remove it again by
executing `removeModuleDB CS2109`. The `removeModuleDB` command returns a feedback informing the admin that the module
“CS2109” does not exist, and no changes is made to `ModuleList` and `moduleList.xml`.

**Editing module from database**

`editModule` mechanism is facilitated by the `EditModuleCommand` class. It allows `Admin` to edit `Module` from the
database.

The `EditModuleCommand` extends for `Command`. Figure 8(shown below) depicts the UML representation of the `EditModuleCommand`.

image::EditModuleCommandUML.png[width="400"]
_Figure 8. UML diagram of `EditModuleCommand`._

Parsing of command is performed by the `EditModuleCommandParser`, which returns a `EditModuleCommand` object after parsing
ModuleCode, Title, Credit, Department, Description, AvailableSem and Prereq. Figure 9(shown below) shows the sequence
diagram of the `EditModuleCommandParser`.

image::SDforEditModuleCommandLogicAndModel.png[width="800]

Figure 10(shown below) shows the high-level sequence diagram of the command execution.

image::SDforEditModuleCommand.png[width="800"]
_Figure 10. High-level sequence diagram of editing a module from database._

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How add & remove executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Interact with `moduleList` loaded from `moduleList.xml`.
** Pros: It is easy to implement.
** Cons: There may be performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Interact directly with `moduleList.xml`
** Pros: There will be less memory used for storing module list.
** Cons: Students may experience performance issues as they have to read from `moduleList.xml` in the hard disk every
time they execute command that requires reading the module list.

===== Aspect: Data structure for module list
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using a list of `Module`.
** Pros: We can simply store `Module` objects directly into the list.
** Cons: We have to iterate through the list to check if a module exist, resulting in a linear time complexity.

* **Alternative 2:** Using a hash map with `ModuleCode` key and `Module` value.
** Pros: We can simply check if a `ModuleCode` key exists, which is fast as it is in constant time.
** Cons: Each module can only have one module code. Thus if a module have multiple module codes, we have to create
another module just to store the other module codes. This can be heavy on memory usage.

// tag::saveuser[]
=== Save User Feature
The save user feature involves mainly the saving process of a user's attributes.
A user can save their data only after they have logged in or registered an account.

[NOTE]
Data refers to a user's attributes listed in `SaveCommand` under the current implementation of the save user feature in the next section.

This section will describe in details the current implementation and the design considerations of the save user feature.

==== Current Implementation
The save mechanism is facilitated by the following classes:

* `SaveCommand` +
The `SaveCommand` stores the following attributes of a `User` object: +

** Attributes that exist in all user:

*** Username +
    The username of a user.
*** Name +
    The name of the user.
*** Role +
    The role of the user.
[NOTE]
`Username` is unique to every user and is used for logging in. `Name` is non-unique and multiple users can use the same `Name`.

** Attributes that only exist in an admin:

*** Salary +
    The salary of an administrator.
*** Employment Date +
    The employment date of an administrator.

** Attributes that only exist in a student:

*** Enrollment Date +
    The enrollment date of a student.
*** Major(s) +
    A list of a student's major.
*** Minor(s) +
    A list of a student's minor.
*** Modules Taken +
    A list of modules took by a student.
*** Modules Staged +
    A list of modules staged for the generation of candidature.
[IMPORTANT]
A student must have *at least one* major and can have no minor.

* `UserStorage` +
It provides methods to save the current user's attributes as well as to load a file containing previously saved data. +
`UserStorage` implements the following operations:
** `StorageManager#saveUser(…​)` — Save the user's data into the specified file path.
** `StorageManager#readUser(…​)` — Reads the user's data from the specified file path.

===== Implementation of the save feature

The `save` mechanism of modsUni is facilitated by `SaveCommand` class and is event-driven.
It allows a user to save their data as an XML file.

[NOTE]
Both admin and student can use the save feature.

The `SaveCommand` class extends from the `Command` class as shown below in Figure 1.

image::SaveCommandUML.png[width="250"]
_Figure 1. SaveCommand UML Diagram_

The parsing of command is performed by `SaveCommandParser`, which returns a `SaveCommand` object after parsing the save file path.
The sequence diagram shown below in Figure 2 illustrates the interactions between the Logic and Model components when the SaveCommand is being executed.

image::SDforSaveCommandLogicAndModel.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2. Sequence Diagram for the interaction between Logic and Model Components when executing SaveCommand_

The `save` feature uses multiple components of the modsUni application.
The sequence diagram shown below in Figure 3 illustrates the interactions between some of these components.
In addition, the sequence diagram also illustrates that `SaveCommand` is driven by the `SaveUserChangedEvent`.

image::SequenceDiagramforSave.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3. High-Level Sequence Diagram for the `save sp/userdata.xml` command_

The `SaveUserChangedEvent` mentioned above is handled by the `Storage` component as shown in Figure 4.

image::SequenceDiagramforSaveEventHandling.png[width="550"]
_Figure 4. High-Level Sequence Diagram showing how the Storage component handles `SaveUserChangedEvent` which was triggered by EventsCenter_

The Storage component makes use of `XmlUserStorage` class to write `User` to a file specified by the file path.
Both the conversion of `User` object to `XmlSerializableUser` as well as writing to file is shown in the following code snippet below:

[source, java]
----
public void saveUser(User user, Path filePath, String password) throws IOException {
    // ... null checks ...
    FileUtil.createIfMissing(filePath);
    XmlFileStorage.saveDataToFile(filePath, new XmlSerializableUser(user, password));
}
----
`XmlFileStorage#saveDataToFile(...)` utilizes `XmlUtil#saveDataToFile(...)` to save the newly created `XmlSerializableUser` object to the file as shown in the code snipplets below:

[source, java]
----
public static void saveDataToFile(Path file, XmlSerializableUser user) throws FileNotFoundException {
    try {
        XmlUtil.saveDataToFile(file, user);
    } catch (JAXBException e) {
        throw new AssertionError("Unexpected exception " + e.getMessage(), e);
    }
}
----


---
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the save mechanism behaves:

1. A student will first log into their account and add their preferred modules.

2. Upon issuing the command `save sp/userdata.xml`, the save command will call `Model#saveUserFile(...)` which then raises `SaveUserChangedEvent`. This `SaveUserChangedEvent` is then handled by `StorageManager`.

3. `StorageManager` then utilizes `XmlUserStorage#saveUser(...)` which saves the file to the file path specified by the user.


[TIP]
A newly registered `Student` would be initialized and automatically logged in which enables the student to perform the save command. +

The following activity diagram shown in Figure 5 summarizes what happens when a user executes the save command.

image::SaveActivityDiagram.png[width="550"]
_Figure 5. Activity Diagram for the save command_

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data to save

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save every attribute of a `User`.
** Pros: Able to restore to any state of a user.
** Cons: Harder to implement as support for converting data of user to XML format needs to be added.
* **Alternative 2:** Save only the staged modules.
** Pros: Will use less storage space (saving only staged module vs saving all user data).
** Cons: Does not restore the state of a user entirely.
// end::saveuser[]

// tag::datasecurity[]
=== Data Security Feature
The data security feature involves mainly the encryption of the user data file when using the `save` command and the decryption of a user data file when logging in using the `login` command. +

[NOTE]
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the algorithm used for encryption.

This section will describe in details the current implementation and the design considerations of the data encryption & decryption feature.

---
==== Current Implementation
The data security feature is facilitated by `DataSecurityUtil` class. +
`DataSecurityUtil` implements the following operations:

* `DataSecurityUtil#encrypt(…​)` — Encrypts a `byte[]` with the specified password and returns the encrypted `byte[]`.
* `DataSecurityUtil#decrypt(…​)` — Decrypts a `byte[]` with the specified password and returns the decrypted `byte[]`.

`DataSecurityUtil` class utilizes `javax.crypto.cipher` and `javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec` packages for the operations mentioned above.

The `Hashing` class is also used to generate an SHA-1 hash to ensure that there are at least 16 bytes (128 bits) which is required to generate `SecretKeySpec`.

The encryption and decryption of user data are performed in `XMLAdaptedUser`.

===== Implementation of the encryption feature

The encryption feature is integrated with the *Save User Feature*.

During the conversion of a `User` object to XML, the encryption is performed in `XMLAdapterUser`, right before the file is written locally.
Currently, only `Username` (for all users) and `Salary` (for administrators) is encrypted.

The following code snippet shown below illustrates the encryption process:

[source, java]
----
public XmlAdaptedUser(User user, String password) {
    // ... null checks ...

    // All users
    this.username = DataSecurityUtil.bytesToBase64(DataSecurityUtil.encrypt(
            user.getUsername().toString().getBytes(), password));
    this.name = user.getName().toString();
    this.role = user.getRole().toString();
    this.pathToProfilePic = user.getPathToProfilePic().toString();

    // Admin
    if (user.getRole() == Role.ADMIN) {
        Admin admin = (Admin) user;
        this.salary = DataSecurityUtil.bytesToBase64(DataSecurityUtil.encrypt(
                admin.getSalary().toString().getBytes(), password));
        this.employmentDate = admin.getEmploymentDate().toString();
    }

    // ... removed for brevity ...
}
----

The sequence diagram shown below in Figure 1 illustrates the integration of encryption with the save user feature.

image::SequenceDiagramforSaveEventHandlingWithEncryption.png[width="550"]
_Figure 1. Sequence Diagram for the interaction between EventsCenter and Storage Components when executing SaveCommand with encryption_


===== Implementation of the decryption feature
The decryption feature is integrated with the login feature under *User Account Management*. +

When `LoginCommand` calls `model.readUser(...)` the loading of user file will commence and the decryption will occur in `XMLAdapterUser#toModelType(...)`.

This is shown in the following code snippets below:

[source, java]
----
public User toModelType(String password) throws IllegalValueException, CorruptedFileException,
        NoSuchPaddingException, InvalidPasswordException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException {

    User user = null;
    checkMandatoryFields();

    // Applies to all user
    String decryptedUsername = decryptUsername(password);

    // Applies to only admin
    if ("ADMIN".equals(role)) {
        checkAdminFields();
        String decryptedSalary = decryptSalary(password);
        user = new Admin(new Username(decryptedUsername), new Name(name), Role.ADMIN, new Salary(decryptedSalary), new EmployDate(employmentDate));
    }
    // ... removed for brevity ...

    return user;
}
----

The code snippets of `decryptUsername(...)` and `decryptSalary(...)` are shown below respectively:

[source, java]
----
private String decryptUsername(String password) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException,
        InvalidPasswordException, CorruptedFileException, NoSuchPaddingException {
    return new String(DataSecurityUtil.decrypt(
            DataSecurityUtil.base64ToBytes(username), password), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
}

private String decryptSalary(String password) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException,
        InvalidPasswordException, CorruptedFileException, NoSuchPaddingException {
    return new String(DataSecurityUtil.decrypt(
        DataSecurityUtil.base64ToBytes(salary), password), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
}
----

The sequence diagram shown below in Figure 2 illustrates the integration of decryption with the login feature.

image::SDforSaveCommandLogicAndModelUserDecryption.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2. Sequence Diagram for the interaction between Logic Component and DataSecurityUtil when executing LoginCommand_

The following activity diagram shown in Figure 3 summarizes what happens in the decryption process when a user executes the login command.

image::DecryptionActivityDiagram.png[width="550"]
_Figure 3. Activity Diagram for decryption feature in the login command_

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How encryption is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement as an inbuilt feature.
** Pros: Confidentiality of a user's data file is preserved at all times.
** Cons: User does not have full control over user data file.
* **Alternative 2:** Implement as a command.
** Pros: User will have more control over data security.
** Cons: Enforcement of data security outside of the application would be harder.

===== Aspect: Generation of security key for encryption/decryption

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generate the key using a user's password.
** Pros: User does not need to supply additional information or file for encryption or decryption.
** Cons: User is unable to decrypt their user data file if they forget their password.
* **Alternative 2:** Generate the key using `KeyGenerator` and an additional file is needed to log in.
** Pros: The key will be more secured compared to the key generated from alternative one since a weak password that is susceptible to password cracking may be used by a user.
** Cons: User is unable to decrypt their user data file if the key file is lost or corrupted.

===== Aspect: What fields to encrypt

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Encrypt some fields (Username and Salary).
** Pros: The encryption of username ensures that a malicious user is unable to correlate a specific user data file to a credential in the credential store.
In addition, advance users can edit unencrypted fields in the user data file.
** Cons: The user data file will contain unencrypted information.
* **Alternative 2:** Encrypt every field.
** Pros: The user data file is secure since every field is encrypted.
** Cons: Advance user are unable to edit from the user data file manually.

=== Load User feature
The load user feature involves mainly the loading process of a user's attributes.
This feature is integrated into the `login` command, however it functions independently from authentication process.

This section will describe in details the current implementation and the design considerations of the load user feature.

==== Current Implementation
The load mechanism is facilitated by the `UserStorage` class.

It provides a method to load the user's attributes from a saved file. +
The following operation is used for the loading process:

`StorageManager#readUser(…​)` — Reads the user's data from the specified file path.

===== Implementation of the save feature

The load mechanism of modsUni is facilitated by `LoginCommand` class and is event-driven.
It allows a user to load their data in modsUni from an XML file.

The load feature uses multiple components of the modsUni application.
Parsing of command is performed by `LoginCommandParser`, which returns a `LoginCommand` object after parsing
the save file path.

The sequence diagram shown below in Figure 1 illustrates the interactions between some of these components.

image::SequenceDiagramforLoginLoad.png[width="800"]
_Figure 1. Sequence Diagram for the interaction between Logic and Model Components when executing LoginCommand_

image::SDforLoginCommandOverviewWithLoad.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2. High-Level Sequence Diagram of the login process._

The Storage component makes use of `XmlUserStorage` class to read `User` from the file specified by the file path.
The conversion from `XmlSerializableUser` to `User` object is shown in the following code snippet below:

[source, java]
----
public Optional<User> readUser(Path filePath, String password) throws DataConversionException, FileNotFoundException {
    // ... null checks ...

    XmlSerializableUser xmlUser = XmlFileStorage.loadUserDataFromSaveFile(filePath);
    try {
        return Optional.of(xmlUser.toModelType(...));
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
        logger.info("Illegal values found in " + filePath + ": " + ive.getMessage());
        throw new DataConversionException(ive);
    }
}
----
The method `XmlFileStorage#loadUserDataFromSaveFile(...)` as shown in the code snippets below:

[source, java]
----
public static XmlSerializableUser loadUserDataFromSaveFile(Path file) throws DataConversionException, FileNotFoundException {
    try {
        return XmlUtil.getDataFromFile(file, XmlSerializableUser.class);
    } catch (JAXBException e) {
        throw new DataConversionException(e);
    }
}
----


---
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the save mechanism behaves:

1. A student will use the login command to log into their account.

2. Upon issuing the login command , the login command will call `Model#readUserFile(...)` which then loads the file into an `XmlSerializableUser` using `XmlFileStorage.loadUserDataFromSaveFile(...)`.

3. The `XmlSerializableUser` object is then converted to an `User` object using the  `XmlSerializableUser#toModelType(...)`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Load command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Loads file together with login.
** Pros: Able to load a user saved file without entering an additional command.
** Cons: Reduce flexibility.
* **Alternative 2:** Load file using an independent load command.
** Pros: More control over when a file is loaded..
** Cons: Additional command which may lead to more bug.
// end::loaduser[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.modsuni.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.modsuni.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.modsuni.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.modsuni.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/modsuni/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, modsUni depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml
.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

_{ more test cases ... }_

=== Generating a schedule

. Generate a schedule using modules in the student's staged list

.. Prerequisites: Login using a student user account and download the sample modules database.
.. Test case: +
 ... `addModuleS cs2030 cs2040`
 ... `generate` +
 Expected: Generate fail due to missing prerequisites.
 .. Test case: +
 ... `addModuleS cs1010`
 ... `generate` +
 Expected: Successful execution of the generate command. Schedule will be shown in the panel on the right
 of the application.
 .. Other failures that might occur:
 ... Invalid user account +
 `login` using an admin account +
 ... No logged in user +
 `generate` without logging in
 ... No modules in staged list +
 `generate` without adding modules to staged list

=== Saving a user

. Saving a user

.. Prerequisites: You must be logged in as a User (Admin or Student).
.. Test case: `save sp/userdata.xml` +
   Expected: You should see a success message at the bottom and a file should be created/overwritten.
    In addition, the main panel should display your current user information.
    The timestamp in the user tab should also be updated.
.. Test case: `save sp/userdata` (without extension) +
   Expected: No data is saved. Error details shown at the bottom of the application.
   Timestamp in user tab should remain the same.
.. Other incorrect save commands to try: `save sp`, `save sp/.xml.xml`, `save xx/userdata.xml` +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Modifying of user data file

. Modify of admin data file

.. Prerequisites: You must have an admin data file (the master admin is provided).
.. Test case: Open up the admin file and edit the contents in the <name> tag. Now login as the admin using the updated user data file. +
Expected: You should see a success login message at the bottom. In addition, you should see the updated name of the admin account. The timestamp in the user tab should be the time you logged in.
.. Test case: Open up the admin file and edit the contents in the <employmentDate> tag (follow the original format of dd/mm/yyyy). Now login as the admin using the updated user data file. +
Expected: You should see a success login message at the bottom. In addition, you should see the updated employment date data of the admin account. The timestamp in the user tab should be the time you logged in.
.. Test case: Open up the admin file and change the order of tags (e.g. swap the order of name and role). Ensure that there are no extra spaces or empty lines.
Now login as the admin using the updated user data file. +
Expected: You should be able to login as per normal and see a success login message at the bottom. The timestamp in the user tab should be the time you logged in.
.. Test case: Open up the admin file and duplicate the tags (e.g. add <name>master2</name> below the existing <name>master</name> tag). Ensure that there are no extra spaces or empty lines.
Now login as the admin using the updated user data file. +
   Expected: You should see a success login message at the bottom. In addition, you should see the admin name to be "master2". The timestamp in the user tab should be the time you logged in.
   You can also duplicate restricted tags(username, role, employmentDate), however the furthest (from the first line) tag will be the one that is read. So you can have invalid values in prior duplicated tags.

.. Test case: Open up the admin file and edit the contents in the <username> tag . Now login as the admin using the updated user data file. +
    Expected: You should see an error message at the bottom.
.. Other invalid modification to try: removing the entire tag, modifying contents from role and salary  +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

. Modify of student data file
.. Prerequisites: You must have a student data file (you can obtain one by registering an account and adding some modules to staged and taken).

.. Test case: Open up the student file and edit the contents in the <name> tag. Now login as the student using the updated user data file. +
Expected: You should see a success login message at the bottom. In addition, you should see the updated name of the student account. The timestamp in the user tab should be the time you logged in.

.. Test case: Open up the student file and edit the contents in the <enrollmentDate> tag (follow the original format of dd/mm/yyyy). Now login as the student using the updated user data file. +
Expected: You should see a success login message at the bottom. In addition, you should see the updated enrollment date data of the student account. The timestamp in the user tab should be the time you logged in.

.. Test case: Open up the student file and edit the contents in the <major> and <minor> tag (you must follow the original format of [a, b, c], with comma and space in-between). Contraints are that you must have at least one major and can have zero minor. The inputs for major and minor must consist of only unaccented alphabetical letters (e.g. a-zA-Z). Now login as the student using the updated user data file. +
Expected: You should see a success login message at the bottom. In addition, you should see the updated major or minor data of the student account. The timestamp in the user tab should be the time you logged in.

.. Test case: Open up the student file and edit the <lockModules> or <parsedPrereq> tag from <moduleStaged> (e.g. instead of <lockModules>CS2030</lockModules> it should look like <lock>CS2030</lock> after editing). Now login as the student using the updated user data file. +
Expected: You should see a success login message at the bottom. The timestamp in the user tab should be the time you logged in. However, that information will not be loaded and may cause generate feature to fail.

.. Test case: Open up the student file and edit any contents in the <moduleTaken> or <moduleStaged> tag (it is recommended to start with <code> so you get a feel of the update). Now login as the student using the updated user data file. +
Expected: You should see a success login message at the bottom. The timestamp in the user tab should be the time you logged in. Now navigate (switch tab/staged or switch tab/taken) staged or taken tab depending on where you change, you should see the updated module code. +
Module information (represented by <code>, <department>, <title>, <description>, <credit>, <isAvailableInSem1>, <isAvailableInSem2>, <isAvailableInSpecialTerm1>, <isAvailableInSpecialTerm2>, <lockedModules>, <parsedPrereq>) are given as it is for testing purpose. If you change the information (module code/prerequisite), the application will generate based on the information in the user data.
So the generate feature may fail depending on what you changed. You can create unique cases such as taking CS2030 without completing CS1010.
An example would be to remove CS1010 as a prerequisite for CS2030 in the user data file. Now when log back in and add CS2030 to staged, you will be able to use the generate feature as expected even without having to add CS1010 to staged or taken.

.. Test case: Open up the student file and edit the contents in the <username> tag . Now login as the student using the updated user data file. +
Expected: You should see an error message at the bottom.

.. Other invalid modification to try: removing the entire <code> tag from a module in <modulesStaged> or <modulesTaken>, remove characters from mandatory tags (code, department, title, description in <modulesTaken or <modulesStaged>),  . +
Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Adding a module

Below are some test cases you can perform to test the `AddModuleToDatabaseCommand` for the database administration feature:
[NOTE]
The below test cases only cater to `Admin` accounts

. Test case: `addModuleDB code/CS2103T department/Computing title/The New Module credit/4 available/1100
             description/This course is newly offered by the school of computing. Visit the module website for more details
             prereq/|(|CS1020,CS1020E,CS2020,)(&CS2030,(|CS2040,CS2040C,))` +
  Expected: A new module is created. The `Module` details as provided in the command should be automatically displayed in
  the database tab. A successful message should be displayed in the Output Display.
  Additionally, the module details is saved in `modules.xml`.
   Examine `modules.xml` to determine if the module is indeed created.
. Prerequisite: A module with module code CS2103T already exists in `modules.xml` +
Test case: `addModuleDB code/CS2103T department/Computing title/The New Module credit/4 available/1100
                        description/This course is newly offered by the school of computing. Visit the module website for more details
                        prereq/|(|CS1020,CS1020E,CS2020,)(&CS2030,(|CS2040,CS2040C,))` +
Expected: No new module is created. Error details should be shown in the Output Display. Rest of the UI remains unchanged.



===  Editing module details

Below are some test cases you can perform to test the `EditModuleCommand` for the module database administration feature:
[NOTE]
The below test cases only cater to `Admin` accounts

. Prerequisite: A module with index 1 already exists in the database tab. +
Test case: `editModule 1 code/#CS1010` +

.. `editModule code/CS1010`
.. `editModule 1 prereq/&&`
.. `editModule 1 prereq/&CS1010`
