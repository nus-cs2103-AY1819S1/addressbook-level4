== Introduction

Hallper is a desktop application aimed at serving <<jcrc,JCRCs>> of the Halls of NUS.
Hallper follows an event-driven architecture, and is designed to work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>>.
This guide provides you with information on how to contribute to Hallper, whether you are a new or experienced developer.

== Setting up

This section tells you how to set up your computer before you can start working on Hallper.

=== Prerequisites

* *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

* *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

Follow these steps to set up the project on your computer:

. Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (If you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

Follow these steps to verify the setup:

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding:

* Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
* Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

This section describes the architecture and components of the application.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component:

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initialising the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level:

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design).
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Controls the UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes commands.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The `Logic` component consists of all the `Command` and `Parser` classes.
It makes use of `AddressBookParser` to parse all user commands.

A typical flow in the `Logic` component is given below:

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component consists of classes that model objects e.g. `Person`, `Calender`, `Email`, etc.
It does not depend on any of the other three components.

The `Model` component:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component consists of classes which are responsible for saving and reading files.

The `Storage` component:

* saves `UserPref` objects in json format and reads it back.
* saves the Address Book data in xml format and reads it back.
* saves emails in eml format and reads it back.
* saves calendars in ics format and reads it back.
* saves the Budget Book data in xml format and reads it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Commons

`Commons` consists of classes used by multiple components and are located in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

===== Command: undo

1) The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

2) The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

3) The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`,
causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

4) The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo`
command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Command: redo

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

*Things to Note*

* Not all commands can undo or redo. Some commands, such as `list`, do not modify the address book and
will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

* Some commands such as `clear`, will calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. In this case, the `currentStatePointer` is
not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: Must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: Do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

//tag::compose[]
=== Compose email feature
==== Current Implementation

The Compose feature works using a third-party dependency, http://www.simplejavamail.org/#/about[Simple Java Mail].
It allows `.eml` files to be saved onto the computer.
The feature is facilitated by `EmailModel` and `EmailDirStorage`.
It implements the following operations:

* `EmailModel#saveComposedEmail(Email email)` -- Stores each newly composed email in the `EmailModel`.
* `EmailDirStorage#saveEmail(EmailModel email)` -- Saves the newly composed email in the `EmailModel` to the computer.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveComposedEmail(Email email)`, and in the `Storage` interface as `Storage#saveEmail(EmailModel email)` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Compose feature behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user executes either the `ComposeEmailList` command or `ComposeEmailIndex` command, which creates an email.
The `ComposeEmailList`/`ComposeEmailIndex` command calls `Model#saveComposedEmail(Email email)`, saving the email to `EmailModel`.

Step 2. Once the email is saved in the `EmailModel`, the `ModelManager` raises an `EmailSavedEvent`, to indicate that a new
 email is saved to the `EmailModel`.

Step 3. The `EmailSavedEvent` goes to the `EventsCenter`, and is then handled by `StorageManager#handleEmailSavedEvent
(EmailSavedEvent event)`, which then calls `EmailDirStorage#saveEmail(EmailModel email)`.
This saves the email to a specified local directory.

Step 4. A preview of the email is displayed on the main window.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Method to create emails

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use http://www.simplejavamail.org/#/about[Simple Java Mail].
** Pros: http://www.simplejavamail.org/#/about[Simple Java Mail] contains various methods to conveniently create emails.
The library is easy to understand so any new developer can easily extend the current features.
** Cons: The design of created emails is limited to the http://www.simplejavamail.org/#/about[Simple Java Mail] API.
* **Alternative 2:** Write a custom email builder.
** Pros: The design of created emails can be freely manipulated.
** Cons: Much more code has to be written.

===== Aspect: Text type

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** HTML text
** Pros: Users with HTML knowledge can manipulate the content of the email.
** Cons: Users unfamiliar with HTML minimally has to learn how the `<br>` tag works.
* **Alternative 2:** Plain text
** Pros: Plain text is easily understood by almost any user.
** Cons: The design of the email content is limited.

//end::compose[]

// tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar feature
==== Current Implementation

The calendar feature in Hallper is implemented using a third-party dependency, https://github.com/ical4j/ical4j[iCal4j].
It creates `.ics` files and saves them onto the local computer. Calendars in Hallper are created as monthly
calendars, a `Map<Year, Set<Month>>` in `CalendarModel` keeps a record of existing calendars in Hallper.
It implements the following commands:

* `create_calendar` -- Creates a monthly calendar and store it in local memory.
* `add_all_day_event` -- Adds an all day event into the monthly calendar specified.
* `add_event` -- Adds an event of a specified time frame into the monthly calendar.
* `delete_event` -- Deletes an existing event in the monthly calendar.

===== Create_Calendar Command
This command is facilitated by `CalendarModel` and `IcsCalendarStorage`.
It implements the following operations:

* `CalendarModel#createCalendar(Year year, Month month)` -- Initializes a calendar object in the `CalendarModel`.
* `CalendarModel#isExistingCalendar(Year year, Month month)` -- Checks if the calendar already exists in Hallper.
* `IcsCalendarStorage#createCalendar(Calendar calendar, String calendarName)` -- Saves the calendar passed from `CalendarModel` to the computer.

These operations are exposed in the 'Model` interface as `Model#createCalendar(Year year, Month month)`, `Model#isExistingCalendar(Year year, Month month)` and in the `Storage` interface as `Storage#createCalendar(Calendar calendar, String calendarName)` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `create_calendar` command behaves at each step:

. The user executes the `create_calendar` command by specifying the month and year.
The `create_calendar` command then calls `Model#isExistingCalendar(Year year, Month month)`, to check whether the
calendar already exists inside Hallper. If it exists, the command does nothing and reflects to the user that the
calendar already exists. Else, the command calls `Model#createCalendar(Year year, Month month)`, initializing a calendar object inside `CalendarModel`.

. Once the calendar object is initialized in the `CalendarModel`, the `ModelManager` raises a `CalendarCreatedEvent`,
 to indicate that a calendar object has been initialized in the `CalendarModel`.

. The `CalendarCreatedEvent` goes to the `EventsCenter`, and is then handled by
`StorageManager#handleCalendarCreatedEvent(CalendarCreatedEvent event)`, which then calls `IcsCalendarStorage#createCalendar(Calendar calendar, String calendarName)`.
This saves the calendar to a specified local directory.

===== Add Event Commands
The `add_all_day_event` and `add_event` command have many similarities, they differ only by their parameters and the number of checks called to verify the validity of the event to be added. Events in Hallper are created as VEvent objects as implemented in the https://github.com/ical4j/ical4j[iCal4j] library.
Both commands are facilitated by `CalendarModel` and `IcsCalendarStorage`. It implements the following operations:

* `CalendarModel#createAllDayEvent(Year year, Month month, int date, String title)` -- Creates an all day event object and saves it inside the loaded calendar in `CalendarModel`.
* `CalendarModel#createEvent(Year year, Month month, int startDate, int startHour, int startMin, int endDate, int endHour, int endMin, String title)` -- Creates an event object with the specified time frame and saves it inside the loaded calendar in `CalendarModel`.
* `CalendarModel#loadCalendar(Year year, Month month)` -- Loads the monthly calendar specified into `CalendarModel`.
* `CalendarModel#isExistingCalendar(Year year, Month month)` -- Checks if the calendar already exists in Hallper.
* `CalendarModel#isValidDate(Year year, Month month, int date)` -- Checks if the date is a valid date in accordance to the Gregorian calendar.
* `CalendarModel#isValidTime(int hour, int min)` -- Checks if the hour and minutes are valid in accordance to the 24 hour format.
* `CalendarModel#isValidTimeFrame(int startDate, int startHour, int startMin, int endDate, int endHour, int endMin)` -- Checks that the end date and time doesn't occur before the start date and time.
* `IcsCalendarStorage#loadCalendar(String calendarName)` -- Loads the specified calendar from the local directory into local memory.
* `IcsCalendarStorage#createCalendar(Calendar calendar, String calendarName)` -- Saves the calendar passed from `CalendarModel` to the local directory.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` and `Storage` interface as :

* `Model#createAllDayEvent(Year year, Month month, int date, String title)`
* `Model#createEvent(Year year, Month month, int startDate, int startHour, int startMin, int endDate, int endHour, int endMin, String title)`
* `Model#loadCalendar(Year year, Month month)`
* `Model#isExistingCalendar(Year year, Month month)`
* `Model#isValidDate(Year year, Month month, int date)`
* `Model#isValidTime(int hour, int min)`
* `Model#isValidTimeFrame(int startDate, int startHour, int startMin, int endDate, int endHour, int endMin)`
* `Storage#loadCalendar(String calendarName)`
* `Storage#createCalendar(Calendar calendar, String calendarName)`

====== Add_All_Day_Event Command
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add_all_day_event` command behaves at each step:

. The user executes the `add_all_day_event` command by specifying the month, year, date and title.
The `add_all_day_event` command then calls `Model#isExistingCalendar(Year year, Month month)`, `Model#isValidDate(Year year, Month month, int date)`, to perform checks on whether the
request to create event is valid. If it fails any one of the checks, the command does nothing and reflects to the user that the request to create event is not valid.
Else, the command calls `Model#createAllDayEvent(Year year, Month month, int date, String title)`, which calls `CalendarModel#createAllDayEvent(Year year, Month month, int date, String title)`.

. `CalendarModel` first calls `CalendarModel#loadCalendar(Year year, Month month)` to load the calendar into `CalendarModel`.

. Once the calendar object is loaded in the `CalendarModel`, it creates an event object and loads it with all the relevant information.

. The `ModelManager` then raises a `AllDayEventAddedEvent`, to indicate an all day event has been created in the `CalendarModel`.

. The `AllDayEventAddedEvent` goes to the `EventsCenter`, and is then handled by
`StorageManager#handleAllDayEventAddedEvent(AllDayEventAddedEvent event)`, which then calls `IcsCalendarStorage#createCalendar(Calendar calendar, String calendarName)`.
This saves the updated calendar back to the local directory.

====== Add_Event Command
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add_event` command behaves at each step:

. The user executes the `add_event` command by specifying the month, year, starting date, starting time, ending date, ending time and title.
The `add_event` command then calls `Model#isExistingCalendar(Year year, Month month)`, `Model#isValidDate(Year year, Month month, int date)`,
`Model#isValidTime(int hour, int min)` and `Model#isValidTimeFrame(int startDate, int startHour, int startMin, int endDate, int endHour, int endMin)` to perform checks on whether the
request to create event is valid. If it fails any one of the checks, the command does nothing and reflects to the user that the request to create event is not valid.
Else, the command calls `Model#createEvent(Year year, Month month, int startDate, int startHour, int startMin, int endDate, int endHour, int endMin, String title)`, which calls `CalendarModel#loadCalendar(Year year, Month month)`.

. `CalendarModel` first calls `CalendarModel#loadCalendar(Year year, Month month)` to load the calendar into `CalendarModel`.

. Once the calendar object is loaded in the `CalendarModel`, it creates an event object and loads it with all the relevant information.

. The `ModelManager` then raises a `CalendarEventAddedEvent`, to indicate an event with a specified time frame has been created in the `CalendarModel`.

. The `CalendarEventAddedEvent` goes to the `EventsCenter`, and is then handled by `StorageManager#handleCalendarEventAddedEvent(CalendarEventAddedEvent event)`, which then calls `IcsCalendarStorage#createCalendar(Calendar calendar, String calendarName)`.
This saves the updated calendar back to the local directory.

===== Delete_Event Command
This command is facilitated by `CalendarModel` and `IcsCalendarStorage`.
It implements the following operations:

* `CalendarModel#loadCalendar(Year year, Month month)` -- Loads the monthly calendar specified into `CalendarModel`.
* `CalendarModel#deleteEvent(Year year, Month month)` -- Deletes an existing event in the monthly calendar.
* `CalendarModel#retrieveEvent(int startDate, int endDate, String title)` -- Retrieves the event object from the calendar.
* `CalendarModel#isSameEvent(int startDate, int endDate, String title, VEvent event)` -- Checks whether the requested event to be deleted is the same event object in the calendar.
* `CalendarModel#isExistingCalendar(Year year, Month month)` -- Checks if the calendar already exists in Hallper.
* `CalendarModel#isValidDate(Year year, Month month, int date)` -- Checks if the date is a valid date in accordance to the Gregorian calendar.
* `CalendarModel#isExistingEvent(Year year, Month month, int startDate, int endDate, String title)` -- Checks if an event exists in the monthly calendar.
* `IcsCalendarStorage#loadCalendar(String calendarName)` -- Loads the specified calendar from the local directory into local memory.
* `IcsCalendarStorage#createCalendar(Calendar calendar, String calendarName)` -- Saves the calendar passed from `CalendarModel` to the local directory.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` and `Storage` interface as :

* `Model#loadCalendar(Year year, Month month)`
* `Model#deleteEvent(Year year, Month month, int startDate, int endDate, String title)`
* `Model#isExistingCalendar(Year year, Month month)`
* `Model#isValidDate(Year year, Month month, int date)`
* `Model#isExistingEvent(Year year, Month month, int startDate, int endDate, String title)`
* `Storage#loadCalendar(String calendarName)`
* `Storage#createCalendar(Calendar calendar, String calendarName)`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `delete_event` command behaves at each step:

. The user executes the `delete_event` command by specifying the month, year, starting date, ending date, and title.
The `delete_event` command then calls `Model#isExistingCalendar(Year year, Month month)`, `Model#isValidDate(Year year, Month month, int date)` and
`Model#isExistingEvent(Year year, Month month, int startDate, int endDate, String title)` to perform checks on whether the request to delete event is valid.
If it fails any one of the checks, the command does nothing and reflects to the user that the request to delete event is not valid. Else, the `Model#isExistingEvent` check will retrieve the event and load it inside the `CalendarModel`. It then calls `Model#deleteEvent(Year year, Month month, int startDate, int endDate, String title)`.

. The `Model#isExistingEvent` check first calls `CalendarModel#loadCalendar(Year year, Month month)` to load the calendar into `CalendarModel`. Once the calendar object is loaded in the `CalendarModel`, it then calls `CalendarModel#retrieveEvent(int startDate, int endDate, String title)` to retrieve the event and store it inside the `CalendarModel` as event to be deleted.

. The call to `Model#deleteEvent(Year year, Month month, int startDate, int endDate, String title)` calls `CalendarModel#deleteEvent(Year year, Month month)` which removes the event to be deleted in `CalendarModel` from the monthly calendar.

. The `ModelManager` then raises a `CalendarEventDeletedEvent`, to indicate an event has been deleted in the `CalendarModel`.

. The `CalendarEventDeletedEvent` goes to the `EventsCenter`, and is then handled by `StorageManager#handleCalendarEventDeletedEvent(CalendarEventDeletedEvent event)`, which then calls `IcsCalendarStorage#createCalendar(Calendar calendar, String calendarName)`.
This saves the updated calendar back to the local directory.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: File format

* **Pro:** The `.ics` file format is compliant with the RFC 5545 format, which is industry recognised, and can be opened
 and viewed using many applications, including Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, and Apple Calendar.
* **Con:** `.ics` file alone is not very useful. User needs to import the events created into users' preferred
calender application manually and consistently. More implementations will be required to make `.ics` files useful in
Hallper.

===== Aspect: Using https://github.com/ical4j/ical4j[iCal4j]

https://github.com/ical4j/ical4j[iCal4j] contains various methods that make creating, parsing and editing `.ics` files convenient.
The library is widely used and easy to understand so any new develeper can easily extend the current features.
// end::calendar[]

// tag::createcca[]
=== Create CCA feature
==== Current Implementation

The `create` mechanism is facilitated by `BudgetBook` and `BudgetBookStorage`.
When a CCA is created, it is stored in a `UniqueCcaList` in the `BudgetBook`, and in a `.xml` file in the local
directory. It implements the following command:

* `BudgetBook#addCca(Cca toAdd)` -- Adds a non existing CCA into the `BudgetBook` in `Model`.
* `BudgetBook#commitBudgetBook()` -- Save a current version of the budget book in the `VersionedBudgetBook`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addCca(Cca cca)`, `Model#hasCca(CcaName name)`,
`Model#hasCca(Cca cca)` and `Model#commitBudgetBook()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the create cca mechanism behaves at each step.

. The user create a new CCA by including the `CCA name` and the 'budget` allocated to the CCA.

. `create` command checks for existing CCA name using `BudgetBook#hasCca(Cca toAdd)`. If a CCA with the same
name exists, the CCA is not created. Otherwise, it is added into the `BudgetBook` in the `Model`.

. `BudgetBook#addCca(Cca cca)` then invokes `ModelManger#indicateBudgetBookChange()` to raise a
`BudgetBookChangedEvent`, which is handled by `EventsCenter`.

. `BudgetBookChangedEvent` is then handled by `StorageManager#handleBudgetBookChangedEvent(BudgetBookChangedEvent
event)`. `StorageManager#saveBudgetBook(ReadOnlyBudgetBook data)` is then called to write the update the existing
`ccabook.xml` file with the new CCA.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Choice of local storage format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves in `.xml` format.
** Pros: Easy to create, understand, move and translate into other environments. International data standard for
storing information.
** Cons: Parsing XML software is slow and cumbersome. Use large amounts of memory due to the verbosity and incur cost
 of parsing large XML files.
* **Alternative 2:** Save in `.json` format.
** Pros: Faster in parsing information.
** Cons: Limited in terms of what objects can be modeled.

// end::createcca[]

// tag::import[]
=== Import feature
==== Current Implementation
The import feature allows `.xml` files of different formats to be imported from the computer.

It implements the following operations and classes:

* `ImportCommand#parseFile()` -- Parses specified path into document for reading.
* `ImportAddressBook#execute(Document doc, Model model)` -- Imports `.xml` file from the specified path to update
Hallper data.
* `ImportCcaList#execute(Document doc, Model model)` -- Imports `.xml` file from the specified path to update Hallper
contacts' CCAs.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#addMultiplePersons()`
and `Model#updateMultiplePersons`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the import mechanism behaves at each step.

. The user imports `.xml` file by specifying the path of the file.

. `ImportCommandParser` checks for the validity of the path and `.xml` file format. If `.xml` file has an invalid
format, the specified file will not be imported.

. `ImportCommand#parseFile()` then prepares the file for reading by parsing into a document.

. `ImportCommand.execute(Model model, CommandHistory history)` then invokes `ImportAddressBook#execute(Document doc,
Model model)` to read the document.

. After the document data is read,  `ImportAddressBook#execute(Document doc, Model model)` then invokes
`ModelManager#addMultiplePersons(List<Person> personList)` to update Hallper's internal list and
`ModelManager#indicateAddressBookChanged()`, which raises an `AddressBookChangedEvent` which is handled by
`EventsCenter`.

. `AddressBookChangedEvent` is then handled by
`StorageManager#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent event)`.
`StorageManager#saveAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook data)` is then called to update the existing `addressbook.xml` file
with the new contacts.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Choice of component to read imported file

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reads file in `Logic`.
** Pros: Easy to change parsing of `.xml` file when `.xml` file format changes. New `.xml` file formats can be added
without disrupting the existing parsers.
** Cons: Importing from the computer is a storage-related feature but the reading of the file is located outside of
Storage component.

* **Alternative 2:** Reads file in `Storage`.
** Pros: Proper grouping of import implementation inside related component.
** Cons: More complicated implementation if more `.xml` file formats are added to be parsed in the future.

// end::import[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export feature
==== Current Implementation
The export feature allows Hallper data to be exported as an `xml` file to the computer.

It implements the following operation:

* `ExportCommand#execute(Model model, CommandHistory history)` -- Exports current Hallper data as an `xml` file to
the specified path.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#exportAddressBook(Path filePath)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the export mechanism behaves at each step.

. The user exports an 'xml' file by specifying the destination path and name of the exported file.

. `ExportCommandParser` checks for the validity of the path and file name. If path or file name are invalid, Hallper
data will not be exported. Otherwise, path and filename will be parsed into a single, full path.

. `ExportCommand#execute(Model model, CommandHistory history)` then invokes
`ModelManager#exportAddressBook(Path filePath)` which raises an `ExportAddressBookEvent`.

. `ExportAddressBookEvent` is then handled by
`StorageManager#handleExportAddressBookEvent(ExportAddressBookEvent event)`.
`StorageManager#exportAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook addressBook, Path path)` is then called to export Hallper's
storage data to the specified path.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Choice of export format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Export `.xml` format only.
** Pros: Easy for user to update and re-import the `.xml` file. Standardised format for Hallper-related data files.
** Cons: Difficult to convert/transfer data to other applications due to limited export format. Need to use external
applications to convert `.xml` file.

* **Alternative 2:** Export `.xml`, `.txt` and `.xlsx` formats.
** Pros: More options for user to export Hallper data. Exported files can be read across different applications.
** Cons: Unused file formats. `.xml` is the format that is mainly used by Hallper so `.txt` and `.xlsx` may be
underused or unused.

// end:export[]

// tag::image[]
=== Image feature

==== Current Implementation
The image feature allows `.jpg` image files to be uploaded into Hallper to a specific person from the computer.
The feature is facilitated by `ProfilePictureDirStorage`. It implements the follow operations:

* `ProfilePictureDirStorage#readProfilePicture(File file)` -- Reads the file that is specified by the user through
a path and returns a copy of the image that is being read.
* `ProfilePictureDirStorage#saveProfilePicture(BufferedImage image, Room number)` -- Saves the copied image into the
computer.

Both operations are exposed in the `Storage` interface as `Storage#readProfilePicture(File file)` and
`Storage#saveProfilePicture(BufferedImage image, Room number)` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the image mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user specifies the file path of the `.jpg` image to be uploaded and the person's room number.

Step 2. `ImageCommandParser` passes the room number and file that is specified by the file path to `ImageCommand`.

Step 3. `ImageCommand` searches Hallper for the person that is tagged with the specified room number. It returns an
error message if the room number specified is not tagged to any person.

Step 4. Once the room number is verified, a `NewImageEvent` is raised from the `ImageCommand` to initiate the reading
and copying of the image from the given file path.

Step 5. The `NewImageEvent` goes to the `EventCenter`, and is then handled by
`StorageManager#handleNewImageEvent(NewImageEvent event)`. `ProfilePictureStorage#readProfilePicture(File file)` is
then called to read the image file. After reading a valid image file, the
`ProfilePictureStorage#saveProfilePicture(BufferedImage image, Room number)` is called to save the image into the
computer.

Step 6. The profile of the person is displayed on the browser panel.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Choice of component to read and save the file

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Read and save image file through `Storage`.
** Pro: Reading and saving files through `Storage` follows the architecture that the project is built upon.
** Con: Informing the user of invalid file path is much more complicated.

* **Alternative 2:** Read and save image file through `ImageCommand`.
** Pro: Informing the user of invalid file path will be similar to when an invalid command is given.
** Con: Reading and saving the image file from `ImageCommand` breaks the architecture of the project.

==== Aspect: Image type
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only `.jpg` image files.
** Pro: Copying the image will be easier since all images saved will be in the form of `.jpg`.
** Con: Limiting users to only being able to upload one type of image file.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow for multiple image file types i.e `.jpg`, `.png`.
** Pro: Increasing the valid image file types allows users to have more choices when choosing the picture to upload.
** Con: Copying of the image will be more complicated since all images will be saved as a `.jpg` image file type.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

`java.util.logging` package is used for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and
logging destinations.

* Logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See
<<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the
specified logging level
* Current log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Detect critical problem which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Able to continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Show information on the noteworthy actions by the App.
* `FINE` : Display eetails that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list
instead of just its size.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide documentation settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file documentation settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes

=== Site template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

Testing is a crucial part of developing your application.
Testing allows you to verify the correctness and usability of your app, before releasing it to users.

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

This section describes the tools used for building, testing, and releasing the application.

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
