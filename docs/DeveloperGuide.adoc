== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a
https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project
dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`).
It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/storage/XmlAdaptedWish.java[`XmlAdaptedWish.java`] and
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of
IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER],
and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well
(e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/url/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`]
and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/url/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so,
resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.url.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-1/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-1/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteWish.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `WishBookChangedEvent` when the Wish Book data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk. This event also triggers the save of wish histories to disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteWishEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `WishListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `WishBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a wish) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Wish Book data.
* stores the data of wish histories.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Wish>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. The elements of the `ObservableList<Wish>` can also
be filtered and sorted to suit the needs of specific commands.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Wish Book`, which `Wish` can reference. This would allow `Wish Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Wish` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Wish Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.WishBook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::implementationmodel[]

=== Model
==== Wish Model
A wish is uniquely identified by its Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) which is generated randomly only once for a
particular wish, upon its creation through the `AddCommand`. A wish stores the following primary attributes:

* Name
* Price
* Date
* Saved Amount
* Url
* Remark
* Tags
* UUID

[NOTE]
It is impossible for the user to create a duplicate wish as it is impossible to modify a wish's UUID.

==== Wish Priority
A wish needs to be prioritised in a specific order such that the wishes with the highest priority will be visible
on the top of the list. In WishBook, the priority is determined primarily by the due date of the wish which is
stored in every wish's `Date` attribute. Ties are broken by `Name`. Further ties are broken by `UUID` as it is possible
for the `Date` and `Name` of two wishes to be identical.

The sorting of the displayed results is done by the `filteredSortedWishes` list. The sorting order is specified by
`WishComparator`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Uniqueness of a Wish
* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Identify a `Wish` by a randomly generated UUID.
** Pros: Extremely low probability of collision.
** Pros: No extra maintenance required upon generation as every `Wish` is unique.
** Cons: UUID does not map to any real world entity and it is used strictly for identification.
** Cons: It is more difficult to system test the `AddCommand` with the current group of methods for system tests as
UUID is randomly generated each time.

* **Alternative 2:** Identify a wish by `Name`, `Price`, `Date`, `Url`, `Tags`. Wishes with identical values for
these attributes will be represented by a single `WishCard`. The `WishCard` will be augmented with a `Multiplicity` to
indicate the number of identical wishes.
** Pros: WishBook will be more compact and every attribute stored in a `Wish` maps to a real entity.
** Cons: Additional attribute `Multiplicity` may have to be frequently edited as it is another
attribute that is affected by multiple commands.

* **Alternative 3:** Identify a wish by a new attribute `CreatedTime`, which is derived from the system time
when the wish is created.
** Pros: The attribute maps to a real entity. It can be an additional information presented to the user about a wish.
** Cons: There might be collisions in `CreatedTime` if the the system time is incorrect.
// end::implementationmodel[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedWishBook`.
It extends `WishBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `WishBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedWishBook#commit()` -- Saves the current wish book state in its history.
* `VersionedWishBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous wish book state from its history.
* `VersionedWishBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone wish book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitWishBook()`, `Model#undoWishBook()` and `Model#redoWishBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedWishBook` will be initialized with the initial wish book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single url book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th wish in the wish book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitWishBook()`, causing the modified state of the url book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `WishBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted url book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new wish. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitWishBook()`, causing another modified wish book state to be saved into the `WishBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitWishBook()`, so the wish book state will not be saved into the `WishBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the wish was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoWishBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous wish book state, and restores the url book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial wish book state, then there are no previous url book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoWishBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoWishBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the wish book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `WishBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest wish book state, then there are no undone url book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoWishBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the wish book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitWishBook()`, `Model#undoWishBook()` or `Model#redoWishBook()`. Thus, the `WishBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitWishBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `WishBookStateList`, all wish book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire wish book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the wish being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of wish book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedWishBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::savingsHistory[]
=== Savings History feature
==== Capturing the state of `WishTransaction`

The current state of the savings history of the `WishBook` is captured by `VersionedWishTransaction`.
`VersionedWishTransaction` extends `WishTransaction` and has an undo/redo history, similar to the implementation of the Undo/Redo feature, and is stored internally as a `wishStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements `VersionedModel` and so contains the implementation of the following operations:

* `VersionedWishTransaction#commit()` -- Saves the current wish transaction state in its history.
* `VersionedWishTransaction#undo()` -- Restores the previous wish transaction state from its history.
* `VersionedWishTransaction#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone wish transaction state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitWishBook()`, `Model#undoWishBook()` and `Model#redoWishBook()` respectively.

==== Capturing the state of each `Wish`

`WishTransaction` keeps track of the state of all wishes in `WishBook` via a `wishMap` which maps the unique ID of a `Wish` to a list of `Wish` states. `WishTransaction` implements `ActionCommandListener` such that any state changing command performed to a `Wish` or the `WishBook` such as `AddCommand()`, `EditCommand()`, `SaveCommand()`, etc will result in the `WishMap` being updated accordingly in `WishTransaction`.

==== Persistent storage

`VersionedWishTransaction`, `WishTransaction` can be easily converted to and from xml using  `XmlWishTransactions`. `XmlWishTransactions` is saved as an xml file when the user explicitly closes the window, thereby invoking `MainApp#stop()` which saves the current state of `VersionedWishTransaction` in the `wishStateList` to hard disk.

If the user's command triggers a change in the state of the `WishBook`, a `WishBookChangedEvent` will be raised, causing the subscribed `StorageManager` to respond by saving both the current state of the `WishBook` and `WishTransaction` to disk.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the savings history mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The default file path storing the previous state of the `WishTransaction` will be retrieved, unless otherwise specified by the user, and the contents from the xml file will be parsed and converted into a `WishTransaction` object via the `XmlWishTransactions` object. If the file at the specified location is behind the current state of the `WishBook`, content of the `WishTransaction` will be overwritten by the `WishBook`.

[NOTE]
The `wishStateList` starts off with the initial state of the `WishTransaction` as the first item in the list.

Step 2. The user executes `add n/iPhone ...` to add a new wish. The `add` command calls `Model#commitWishBook()`, causing the current state of the modified wish transaction state to be saved into `wishStateList`. As this is a command that changes the state of the `WishBook`, `Model#addWish()` will call `VersionedWishTransaction#addWish()` to add a new wish to the `WishMap`.

[NOTE]
* If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitWishBook()`, so the wish transaction state will not be saved into the `wishStateList`.
* If the `WishMap` contains an identical wish (such is identified by `Wish#isSameWish()`), then the call to add this wish will fail. As such, the wish will not be added to the `WishMap` or the `WishBook`.

Step 3. The user now decides that adding the wish was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoWishBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous wish transaction state, and restores the wish transaction to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial wish transaction state, then there are no previous wish transaction states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoWishBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoWishBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the wish transaction to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `wishStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest wish transaction state, then there are no undone wish transaction states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoWishBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 4. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the state of the `WishBook`, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitWishBook()`, `Model#undoWishBook()` or `Model#redoWishBook()`. Thus, the `WishBookStateList` remains unchanged.

Step 5. The user finally exits the app by clicking on the close button. The most recent state of the `WishTransaction` will be converted into xml format via the the `XmlWishTransactions` object and be saved into the same file path it was first retrieved from.

[NOTE]
If there was some error saving the current state of the `WishTransaction` to the specified file path in hard disk, an exception will be thrown and a warning will be shown to the user. The current state of the `WishTransaction` object will not be saved to hard disk.
// end::savingsHistory[]

// tag::wish[]
=== Add Wish feature

==== Current Implementation

The Add Wish feature is executed through an `AddCommand` by the user, which after parsing,
is facilitated mainly by the `ModelManager` which implements `Model`.
It also affects `versionedWishBook` and `versionedWishTransaction` by adding the
resultant wish to both of their respective data structures.
After adding a `Wish`, the `filteredSortedWishes` is also updated to reflect the
latest version of WishBook.
The UI is also prompted to refresh through a `WishBookChangedEvent`.

`AddCommandParser` parses the user's input for parameters using prefixes,
and checks them against their respective regular expressions (regex), specified
in their respective classes.

====

The following prefix/parameter pairs are **compulsory**, where a user's input will be
rejected if they are not provided:

* `n/`: Name
* `p/`: Price
* One of the following Date parameters:
** `d/`: Exact expiry date
** `a/`: duration (or lifetime) from time when command is entered

The following prefix/parameter pairs are **optional**, where a user's input will
be successful even if they are not provided:

* `t/`: tags (more than one allowed)
* `u/`: product's URL (product page)

====

[NOTE]
====
**Regarding Duration (`a/`) vs Date (`d/`)**

* If `d/` is used, a valid Date should be used.
** Date comes in the format of `dd/mm/yyyy`,
`dd` being days, `mm` being months, `yyyy` being the year, and the
** Specified date should also be a valid date in the future.
* If `a/` is used, a valid Duration should be used.
** length instead of `dd/mm/yyyy` format, the format should be `<years>y<months>m<days>d`.
* In any command, only `Duration` or `Date` can be used. Never both.
* If an invalid string for date or duration is provided, a warning will be
displayed to prompt the user to enter a valid date or duration.

====

Given below is an example usage scenario and how an AddCommand is carried out.

Step 1. The user types in a valid `AddCommand`, `add n/1 TB Toshiba SSD p/158 a/200d`, and the current date is 2nd October 2017 (2/10/2017).

The `AddCommandParser` will employ `ParserUtil` to parse the attributes specified after each prefix. The parsing of the
`Duration` attribute which follows `a/` in the command will be discussed below.

Since `Duration` prefix is used, the computation of a wish's expiry date is handled
internally in the `ParserUtil` class, which `ParserUtil#parseDate()` parses and converts
the input string into a `Period` object (if input is valid),
and adds the resultant `Period` to the current `Date` to get the desired
`Date` of the `Wish`.

The resultant `Wish` will have the following properties:

* id: `a randomly-generated UUID`
* Name: _1TB Toshiba SSD_
* SavedAmount: 0.00
* Price: 158.00
* Date: 20/4/2018 (20th April 2018)
* URL: `empty string`
* Remark: `empty string`
* Tags: `none`
* Fulfilled: `false`
* Expired: `false`

The resultant wish is pass into `VersionedWishBook#addWish` and `VersionedWishTransaction#addWish`,
which tracks the history of the `WishBook` and `Wish` respectively. The list of wishes shown on the UI is also updated to show all wishes again,
as `filteredSortedWishes` is updated to have all wishes in `WishBook` and a `WishBookChangedEvent` is fired.

The following sequence diagram shows how an `AddCommand` is processed in WB:

image::AddWishSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. Some time later, the user decides that she wants the exact same wish,
but duplicated, and enters the exact same command, but with an exact `Date`
instead of `Duration`, so the command entered is
`add n/1 TB Toshiba SSD p/158 d/20/4/2018`.

Since `Date` prefix is used, the `ParserUtil` parses the string into a `Date` object,
and the resultant object is used directly for the resultant `Wish`.

Similar to in Step 1, the command will be parsed successfully and a second `Wish`
will be added, albeit with a different (hidden) id generated.

The resultant `Wish` will have the following properties:

* id: `another randomly-generated UUID`
* Name: _1TB Toshiba SSD_
* SavedAmount: 0.00
* Price: 158.00
* Date: 20/4/2018 (20th April 2018)
* URL: `empty string`
* Remark: `empty string`
* Tags: `none`
* Fulfilled: `false`
* Expired: `false`

==== Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Different prefixes for `Duration` and `Date`.
** Pros: More focused user experience.
User get more specific feedback depending on their preferred way of inputting date if a wrong input was made.
If user uses `a/` and enters an incorrect `Duration`, the user will not receive an error message about the correct format
for an exact `Date`, and will only be notified of the correct format of a `Duration`.
** Pros: Easier to implement and handle isolate errors related to respective input parameters.
** Cons: More prefixes for user to remember.

* **Alternative 2**: Have `Duration` and `Date` use the same prefix.
** Pros: More natural usage of one prefix to determine `Wish` 's desired expiry date.
** Cons: Conflating implementation of `Duration` and `Date`, hence harder to debug.
** Cons: Tricky to implement, as we are parsing one input for two different desired formats.

=== Save Amount feature

==== Current Implementation

The Save Amount feature is executed through a `SaveCommand` by the user, which after parsing,
is facilitated mainly by the `ModelManager` which implements `Model`.
Wish stores the `price` and `savedAmount` of `Wish`, helping to track the progress of the savings towards the `price`.
Meanwhile, WishBook stores an `unusedFunds`, which is an unallocated pool of funds that can be used in the future.
After adding a saving, the `filteredSortedWishes` in `ModelManager` is updated to reflect the latest observable WishBook.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the SaveCommand behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user executes `save 1 10`, to save $10 into an existing wish with `Index` 1 and `Price` $15. The $10 is
wrapped in an `Amount` and a `SaveCommand` instance is created with the `Amount`. `Amount` is then used to make an updated
instance of the `Wish` at index 1 whose `SavedAmount` will be updated. `Model#updateWish` is then called to update this
wish with the old one in `WishBook`.

[NOTE]
The `Index` of each `Wish` is labelled at the side of the app.

The resultant wish will have the following properties:

* Name: _1TB Toshiba SSD_
* SavedAmount: 10.00
* Price: 15.00
* Date: 20/4/2018 (20th April 2018)
* URL: `empty string`
* Remark: `empty string`
* Tags: `none`
* Fulfilled: `false`
* Expired: `false`

[NOTE]
`Amount` to be saved can be a negative value where it would mean a withdrawal of money from a particular wish.

[NOTE]
`SavedAmount` of a wish cannot be negative. This means that an `Amount` cannot be negative enough to cause `SavedAmount`
to be negative.

Step 2. The user decides to execute `save 1 10` again. However, SaveCommand checks that `savedAmount` > `price`.
SaveCommand#execute creates a new updated `Wish` with `savedAmount = wish.getPrice()`.

The resultant wish will have the following properties:

* Name: _1TB Toshiba SSD_
* SavedAmount: 15.00
* Price: 15.00
* Date: 20/4/2018 (20th April 2018)
* URL: `empty string`
* Remark: `empty string`
* Tags: `none`
* Fulfilled: `true`
* Expired: `false`

Step 3. The excess amount of $5 is stored in a new `Amount` variable `excess`.
SaveCommand#execute then calls Model#updateUnusedFunds(excess) to update the `unusedFunds` in WishBook.

In WishBook, the result would be:

* unusedFunds: 5.00

Step 4. The user tries to execute `save 1 10` again. However, since the value for Wish#isFulfilled is true, the amount
will not be saved. SaveCommand#execute will throw a CommandException, with the message "Wish has already been fulfilled!".

The following sequence diagram shows how the save operation works:

image::SaveCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Data structure to support the unusedFunds feature

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store it in a `SavedAmount` variable in `WishBook`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: More methods needed when needing to move funds from `unusedFunds` to other wishes.
* **Alternative 2:** Store it as a pseudo wish with index 0.
** Pros: It can be treated as another `wish`, hence existing methods can be used without needing to create much
more new ones.
** Cons: Requires dealing with an extra wish that has to be hidden on the `WishListPanel` and displayed separately
on the UI.
We must remember to skip this wish in methods that involve displaying the WishList.

// end::save[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find Wish Feature

==== Current Implementation

The find mechanism is supported by `FindCommandParser`. It implements `Parser` that implements the following operation:

* `FindCommandParser#parse()` -- Checks the arguments for empty strings and throws a `ParseException` if empty string is
found. It then splits the arguments using `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` and returns an `ArgumentMultimap`. Keywords of
the same prefix are then grouped using `ArgumentMultimap#getAllValues()`.

The find mechanism is also facilitated by `FindCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the
following operation:

* `FindCommand#execute()` -- Executes the command by updating the current `FilteredSortedWishList` with the
`WishContainsKeywordPredicate`.

The predicate `WishContainsKeywordsPredicate`, takes in three lists of the keywords for the following attributes:

* Name
* Tags
* Remark

and also the `isExactMatch` argument. The result of the predicate is determined by checking
whether a `Wish` contains the given keywords at their corresponding attributes. The match threshold
is dictated by the value of `isExactMatch`.

==== Example

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `find n/wat n/apple t/impor` command to get all wishes whose name contains the
keywords 'iphone' or 'tablet'.

Step 3. The `FindCommandParser#parse()` is called and the `WishContainsKeywordPredicate` is constructed with
the arguments of the find command.

Step 4. `FindCommand#execute()` is then called.

Step 5. The entire list of wishes is filtered by the predicate `WishContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

Step 6. The filtered list of wishes is returned to the GUI.

image::FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Argument format

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Require the user to prepend every keyword argument with the appropriate
Wish attribute prefix.
** Pros: Easier to implement as it easier to match keyword against a Wish if the attribute to match against is known.
** Pros: User has more control over the results returned.
** Cons: User is required to type slightly more.

* **Alternative 2:** No prefixes are required in the arguments. Keywords can match with any one of the
following chosen wish attributes: `Name`, `Tags` or `Remark`.
** Pros: Less typing required from user.
** Cons: Command might be slightly slower as every keyword has to be checked against all chosen attributes of the
wish.
** Cons: User has less control over the results returned.

==== Aspect: Default threshold for match without the exact match flag
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Keywords appended to different prefixes are grouped with a logical AND and
keywords appended to the same prefixes are grouped with a logical OR when being matched against a `Wish`.
** Pros: A more intuitive way to find wishes.
** Cons: Can be restrictive in some situations.

* **Alternative 2:** Keywords appended to different prefixes are grouped with a logical OR and
keywords appended to the same prefixes are grouped with a logical OR when being matched against a `Wish`.
** Pros: Search results will be more inclusive.
** Cons: Very slim chance for such a use case.
// end::find[]

// tag::list[]
=== List feature

The `list -c and list -u` command allows the user to view the list of all wishes, completed and ongoing, respectively.
A wish is completed if the savedAmount is greater or equal to the price of the wish.

==== Current Implementation


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list overdue mechanism behaves at each step:

.  The user executes the command `list -c`.
.  `model.updateFilteredWishList()` will update the wish list with `WishCompletedPredicate` as the parameter (boolean). `wish.isFulfilled()` is called to check whether the wish is completed or not.
.  The updated wish list would be reflected on the UI to be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Wish Detail Panel displays its updated content:

image::ListCompletedSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]
// end::list[]

// tag::redesign[]
=== Redesign of User Interface

The UI has been redesigned to implement the following UI components required for WishBook:

* Command Box
* Wish List Panel
* Wish Detail Panel


==== Wish List Panel

The Wish List Panel consists of a list of Wish Card which contains 4 UI elements:

* `WishCard#nameLabel` - A `Text` element that displays the wish’s name.
* `WishCard#progressLabel` - A `Text` element that displays the wish’s saving progress in percentage format.
* `WishCard#tags` - A `FlowPane` element that contains a `Text` element which displays the wish’s assigned tags.
* `WishCard#progressBar` - A `progressBar` element that visually presents the percentage of the wish’s current saving progress.

Whenever the user adds a new wish or edits an existing wish, a new WishCard containing the wish will be added to the Wish List Panel or the content in the existing WishCard will be updated respectively.

The user will be able to view the wish’s current saving progress both in terms of text on the progressLabel (e.g. ’80%’) and the progressBar. Also, the user will be able to see all the tags he/she assigned to categorize the wish.

===== Problem with the old design

The UI (MainWindow) constructs the `WishListPanel` by obtaining an `ObservableList` of wish cards from `Model`, this list is assigned when UI starts, and will never be re-assigned.
The UI "observes" the list and updates when it is modified.

This approach works well for the `WishListPanel` because WishBook contains only 1 list of wish cards.
However, the saving history list in the `WishDetailPanel` can not be updated in the same manner because Model component will change its card list’s reference when a user adds a new wish or updates the content of the wish.

In this case, the `WishDetailPanel` in UI will not be updated because the card list of which UI has reference to is actually not changed.

===== Design considerations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Have a wishList in `Model` and keep it updated with the current list of cards
** Explanation: The UI needs only 1 reference to this `wishList`, each time user executes any changes, `wishList` is cleared and the new list of cards is copy to the `wishList`.
** Pros: The structure of `Model` and UI component needs not be changed
** Cons: Need to keep a copy of the current card list, copying the whole list of cards for each command operation has bad effect on performance .

* **Alternative 2**: Model component raises an event when its current card list’s reference is changed
** Explanation: When user adds a new wish or executes save, `Model` will raise an event (`WishPanelUpdatedEvent`), which is subscribed by UI, then UI can re-assign its list of cards and update the cards panel accordingly.
** Pros: Better performance
** Cons: Need to re-design `Model` and UI components 

==== Wish Detail Panel

The Wish Detail Panel consists of 3 UI sub-components:

* `WishDetailSavingAmount` that contains `Text` elements to display price and the saving progress of the wish
* `WishDetailSavingHistory` that contains a `List` of history of saving inputs of the wish
* `WishBrowserPanel` that displays `WebView` of the URL of the wish.

Whenever the user adds a new wish or edits an existing wish, the content of the wish in Wish Detail Panel will be updated.
The user will be able to view the wish’s current saving progress and the history of his/her saving inputs of the wish in the list format.
Also, the user will be able to browse through the wish’s product page via its assigned URL.

===== Current Implementation

Every time a new Wish is added or an existing wish is updated by the commands such as save, it raises a `WishDataUpdatedEvent`.
The UI will then handle that event and update the `WishDetailPanel` with the new version of wish.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the WishBook behaves and `WishDetailPanel` is updated at each step:

.  The user executes the command `save 1 1000`.

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, WishDataUpdatedEvent will not be posted.

.  The save command updates the model with the new wish and raises a new `WishDataUpdatedEvent`.
.  `WishDetailSavingAmount` and `WishDetailSavingHistory` responds to the `WishDataUpdatedEvent` with `WishListPanel#handleWishUpdatedEvent()`.
.  The `WishDetailSavingAmount` updates the wish’s current saving progress when `WishDetailSavingAmount#loadWishDetails` is called.
.  The progress is calculated from when `Wish#getProgress` is called. The value is saveAmount / price. Then the progress label for the wish is set to that fraction.
.  The `WishDetailSavingHistory` updates the wish’s saving history list when `WishDetailSavingHistory#loadWishDetails` is called.
.  The saving history list is cleared.
.  The new set of history entry is retrieved from `wishTransaction#getWishMap` and the saved amount is calculated from subtracting previous saving amount from the next one.
.  The saving history list is now filled with the new list of updated saving history.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Wish Detail Panel displays its updated content:

image::WishDetailPanelSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

===== Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to update the progress and saving history on UI**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Clear all the sub components and add new sub components accordingly
** Pros: No matter which progress or history is changed, or what type of change (ie. delete, add, or edit), this change can be handled by the same method each time.
** Cons: It is redundant to clear everything and replace them with new sub components.

* **Alternative 2**: Handle different kinds of changes to the progress or history lists.
** Pros: It is a lot faster to only change the sub component that is affected.
** Cons: There are too many cases for how the lists can be changed. (ie. a different change is needed for each of these cases: wish is deleted/edited/created/cleared, or a `wishTransaction` is deleted/added)

// end::redesign[]

// tag::savingsNotifications[]
=== [Proposed] Savings Notifications
==== Justification
Some users may have many wishes, all of which have a different targeted date of completion and different price.
It may thus be difficult for users to keep track of how much they need to consistently save to fulfil their various
wishes on time.
This Savings Notification feature will allow users to opt for daily/weekly/monthly notifications for each specific wish,
reminding them of the amount that they need to save at the beginning of the chosen time period.
This will help users to consistently save towards their wishes.

// end::savingsNotifications[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.url.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.url.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.url.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.url.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Wish Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
