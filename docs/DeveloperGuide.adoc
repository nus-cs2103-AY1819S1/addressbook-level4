## 1. Setting up

### 1.1. Prerequisites
JDK 9 or later

JDK 10 on Windows will fail to run tests in headless mode due to a JavaFX bug. Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK 9.
IntelliJ IDE

IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed.
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to File > Settings > Plugins to re-enable them.

### 1.2. Setting up the project in your computer
Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer

Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click File > Close Project to close the existing project dialog first)

Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle

Click Configure > Project Defaults > Project Structure

Click New… and find the directory of the JDK

Click Import Project

Locate the build.gradle file and select it. Click OK

Click Open as Project

Click OK to accept the default settings

Open a console and run the command gradlew processResources (Mac/Linux: ./gradlew processResources). It should finish with the BUILD SUCCESSFUL message.
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

Open XmlAdaptedtask.java and MainWindow.java and check for any code errors

Due to an ongoing issue with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully

To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press ALT+ENTER, and select Add '--add-modules=…' to module compiler options for each error

Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check XmlUtilTest.java and HelpWindowTest.java for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

### 1.3. Verifying the setup
Run the seedu.address.MainApp and try a few commands

Run the tests to ensure they all pass.

### 1.4. Configurations to do before writing code
#### 1.4.1. Configuring the coding style
This project follows oss-generic coding standards. IntelliJ’s default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

Go to File > Settings… (Windows/Linux), or IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences… (macOS)

Select Editor > Code Style > Java

Click on the Imports tab to set the order

For Class count to use import with '*' and Names count to use static import with '*': Set to 999 to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements

For Import Layout: The order is import static all other imports, import java.*, import javax.*, import org.*, import com.*, import all other imports. Add a <blank line> between each import

Optionally, you can follow the UsingCheckstyle.adoc document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

#### 1.4.2. Updating documentation to match your fork
After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the se-edu/addressbook-level4 repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to se-edu/addressbook-level4), you should do the following:

Configure the site-wide documentation settings in build.gradle, such as the site-name, to suit your own project.

Replace the URL in the attribute repoURL in DeveloperGuide.adoc and UserGuide.adoc with the URL of your fork.

#### 1.4.3. Setting up CI
Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See UsingTravis.adoc to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see UsingCoveralls.adoc).

Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.
Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see UsingAppVeyor.adoc).

Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)
#### 1.4.4. Getting started with coding
When you are ready to start coding,

Get some sense of the overall design by reading Section 2.1, “Architecture”.

Take a look at Appendix A, Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started.

## 3. Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1. Undo/Redo feature
#### 3.1.1. Current Implementation
Look at https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/addressbook-level4/DeveloperGuide.html#implementation
Its really good

### 3.3. Logging
We are using java.util.logging package for logging. The LogsCenter class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

The logging level can be controlled using the logLevel setting in the configuration file (See Section 3.4, “Configuration”)

The Logger for a class can be obtained using LogsCenter.getLogger(Class) which will log messages according to the specified logging level

Currently log messages are output through: Console and to a .log file.

Logging Levels

SEVERE : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application

WARNING : Can continue, but with caution

INFO : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App

FINE : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### 3.4. Configuration
Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: config.json).

## 4. Documentation
We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.
### 4.1. Editing Documentation
See UsingGradle.adoc to learn how to render .adoc files locally to preview the end result of your edits. Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your .adoc files in real-time.

### 4.2. Publishing Documentation
See UsingTravis.adoc to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

### 4.3. Converting Documentation to PDF format
We use Google Chrome for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome’s PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

Follow the instructions in UsingGradle.adoc to convert the AsciiDoc files in the docs/ directory to HTML format.

Go to your generated HTML files in the build/docs folder, right click on them and select Open with → Google Chrome.

Within Chrome, click on the Print option in Chrome’s menu.

Set the destination to Save as PDF, then click Save to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

chrome save as pdf
Figure 10. Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
### 4.4. Site-wide Documentation Settings
The build.gradle file specifies some project-specific asciidoc attributes which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

Attributes left unset in the build.gradle file will use their default value, if any.
Table 1. List of site-wide attributes
Attribute name	Description	Default value
site-name

The name of the website. If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.

not set

site-githuburl

URL to the site’s repository on GitHub. Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.

not set

site-seedu

Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project. This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.

not set

### 4.5. Per-file Documentation Settings
### 4.6. Site Template
The files in docs/stylesheets are the CSS stylesheets of the site. You can modify them to change some properties of the site’s design.

The files in docs/templates controls the rendering of .adoc files into HTML5. These template files are written in a mixture of Ruby and Slim.

Modifying the template files in docs/templates requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor’s API. You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site’s layout than what stylesheets can provide. The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

## 5. Testing
### 5.1. Running Tests
There are three ways to run tests.

The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.
Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner

To run all tests, right-click on the src/test/java folder and choose Run 'All Tests'

To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose Run 'ABC'

Method 2: Using Gradle

Open a console and run the command gradlew clean allTests (Mac/Linux: ./gradlew clean allTests)

See UsingGradle.adoc for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.
Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)

Thanks to the TestFX library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the headless mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command gradlew clean headless allTests (Mac/Linux: ./gradlew clean headless allTests)

### 5.2. Types of tests
We have two types of tests:

#### GUI Tests
These are tests involving the GUI. They include:

System Tests that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the systemtests package.

Unit tests that test the individual components. These are in seedu.address.ui package.

#### Non-GUI Tests
These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,

Unit tests targeting the lowest level methods/classes.
e.g. seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest

Integration tests that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working).
e.g. seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest

Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together.
e.g. seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest

### 5.3. Troubleshooting Testing
Problem: HelpWindowTest fails with a NullPointerException.

Reason: One of its dependencies, HelpWindow.html in src/main/resources/docs is missing.

Solution: Execute Gradle task processResources.

## 6. Dev Ops
### 6.1. Build Automation
See UsingGradle.adoc to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### 6.2. Continuous Integration
We use Travis CI and AppVeyor to perform Continuous Integration on our projects. See UsingTravis.adoc and UsingAppVeyor.adoc for more details.

### 6.3. Coverage Reporting
We use Coveralls to track the code coverage of our projects. See UsingCoveralls.adoc for more details.

### 6.4. Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use Netlify to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See UsingNetlify.adoc for more details.

### 6.5. Making a Release
Here are the steps to create a new release.

Update the version number in MainApp.java.

Generate a JAR file using Gradle.

Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. v0.1

Create a new release using GitHub and upload the JAR file you created.

### 6.6. Managing Dependencies
A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the Jackson library for XML parsing. Managing these dependencies can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives.
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

Appendix A: Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started
Suggested path for new programmers:

First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in Section A.1, “Improving each component”.

Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. Section A.2, “Creating a new command: remark” explains how to go about adding such a feature.
