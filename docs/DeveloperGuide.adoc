By: `Team CS2103T-AY1819S1-W17-3`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.meeting.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `MeetingBookChangedEvent` when MeetingBook data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `GroupListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `MeetingBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::updatedModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the MeetingBook data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Group>` that can be 'observed'
e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list and a `Group` list in `MeetingBook`, which `Person` can reference.
This would allow `MeetingBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, and one `Group` object per
unique `Group`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` and `Group` object.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the MeetingBook data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.meetingbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::person[]
=== Person feature

==== Current Implementation

.The enhanced Person class
image::PersonClassDiagram.png[width="300"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/person/Person.java[`Person.java`]

* `Person` now supports group identification. Every person will keep a list of groups that he/she has enrolled in.
* Every `Person` in MeetingBook can be added or removed from an existing group. Use the methods `addGroup()` and `removeGroup`.
* `Person` can check whether he/she is in a particular group by `hasGroup(Group group)` method.
// end::person[]

// tag::group[]
=== Group feature

==== Current Implementation

.The new Group class
image::GroupClassDiagram.png[width="300"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/group/Group.java[`Group.java`]

The `Group`,

* is identified by `Title` and `Description`.
* contains the `Meeting` details for this particular group. This is an optional field.
* keeps track of its members in a `UniquePersonList`. The method `hasMember(Person person)` can check the enrollment of a particular `Person`.
* supports add and remove member using methods `addMember(Person toAdd)` and `removeMember(Person toRemove)`.
* exposes an unmodifiable `List<Person>` for observation of member enrollment status by `getMembersView()`.
* supports set and cancel of `Meeting` of this group by methods `setMeeting(Meeting meeting)` and `cancelMeeting()`.

==== Usage of Group class
A `Group` can be added and removed from `MeetingBook` using `addGroup` and `deleteGroup` command respectively.

Once the `Group` exists in the `MeetingBook`, the existing `Person` can be assigned to that group using `join` command.
The person can also be removed from the group by `leave` command.

Each `Group` can keep track of a list of its members. This is supported by `UniquePersonList` class.

Each `Person` can also keep a list of groups he/she enrols in. An `UniqueGroupList` is added to support this functionality.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Management of group relationship

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `add` and `remove` operations support bidirectional update of relationships.
** Pros: Less complexity in current project structure.
** Cons: The future optimisation of these operations is less flexible.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a central `groupManager` to manage the group-person relationships on the `MeetingBook level`.
** Pros: Greater room for possible future improvement, and ability to contain more complex relationships required by potential users.
** Cons: The idea is less compatible with the current project structure. Extensive change in structure and logic must be performed, and is error-prone.
// end::group[]

// tag::uniqueGroupList[]
=== UniqueGroupList feature

.The UniqueGroupList class
image::uniqueGroupListClassDiagram.png[width="500"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/group/UniqueGroupList.java[`UniqueGroupList.java`]

The `UniqueGroupList`,

* ensures a list of `Group` objects without duplicates.
* supports `add`, `remove` and `replace` operations on groups in the list.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Group>` for observation of the list.

[NOTE]
Both `UniqueGroupList` and `UniquePersonList` implements `Iterable` interface.
// end::uniqueGroupList[]

// tag::addgroup/deletegroup[]
=== AddGroup and DeleteGroup feature
The AddGroup and DeleteGroup commands modify the `UniqueGroupList` in the `versionedMeetingBook`.
This section shows how the addGroup and deleteGroup commands are implemented.

==== `addGroup` command usage
The `addGroup` command allows user to add a new group with user input title to the MeetingBook.
This command is executed with the following syntax: +

Syntax: `addGroup n/[Name]` +

Example: `addGroup n/CS2103T`: adds a new group with title 'CS2103T' into the MeetingBook.

*The follow sequence diagram shows how addGroup command functions.*

.Sequence diagram for addGroup command
image::AddGroupCommand.png[width="350"]


==== `deleteGroup` command usage
The `deleteGroup` command allows user to remove an existing group from the MeetingBook.
This command is executed with the following syntax: +

Syntax: `deleteGroup n/[Name]` +

Example: `deleteGroup n/CS2101`: removes the existing group with title 'CS2101' from the MeetingBook.

*The follow sequence diagram shows how deleteGroup command functions.*

.Sequence diagram for deleteGroup command
image::DeleteGroupCommand.png[width="350"]

==== Implementation of `addGroup` and `deleteGroup` commands
The `versionedMeetingBook` maintains a `UniqueGroupList` to keep track of all groups
that exist in this MeetingBook. The commands thus modify and update this list of groups through `ModelManager`.
// end::addgroup/deletegroup[]

// tag::join/leave[]
=== Join and Leave feature
The Join and Leave commands modify the relationship between groups existed in the `UniqueGroupList` and
people in the `UniquePersonList` maintained by `versionedMeetingBook. This section provides description of the usage
and implementation of these commands.

==== `join` command usage
The `join` command updates relationship between a person and a group existed in the MeetingBook.
The person specified by name now becomes a member of the group specified by title.
This command is executed with the following syntax: +

Syntax: `join n/[Name] g/[Group]` +

Example: `join n/Derek g/CS2101`: makes the person 'Derek' become a member of group 'CS2101'

*The follow sequence diagram shows how join command functions.*

.Sequence diagram for join command
image::JoinCommand.png[width="500"]


==== `leave` command usage
The `leave` command updates relationship between person and group in the same way as the `join` command.
The person specified by name now stops to be a member of the group specified by title.
And the person is removed from this group. This command is executed with the following syntax: +

Syntax: `leave n/[Name] g/[Group]` +

Example: `leave n/Ben g/CS2103T`: removes the person `Ben` from the group `CS2103T`.

*The follow sequence diagram shows how leave command functions.*

.Sequence diagram for leave command

image::LeaveCommand.png[width="500"]

==== Implementation of `join` and `leave` commands
The `versionedMeetingBook` maintains a `UniqueGroupList` to keep track of all groups that exist in this MeetingBook.
It also maintains a `UniquePersonList` to keep track of all people that exist in this MeetingBook.
The commands thus modify and update a pair of person and group, as specified by user input, in their respective list
through `ModelManager`.
// end::join/leave[]


// tag::meeting[]
=== Meeting feature

`Meeting` is one of the central feature of this application. It allows the user to create a reminder of an upcoming event associated with a `Group`.

[NOTE]
A `Group` can only have a maximum of one `Meeting` at any given time.

==== Current Implementation
.The Meeting class

image::meetingClassDiagram.png[width="300"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/group/Meeting.java[`Meeting.java`]

The `Meeting`,

Meeting encapsulates information of a meeting.

* contains the title, time, location and description of a meeting.
* resides in `Group` objects and can be assigned to a group using the `meet` command which utilises the `updateGroup` method of the `Model` interface.
* each `Group` object can have a maximum of one meeting.
* two `Meetings` are considered similar if they share the same title, time, and location

==== Usage of Meeting class

In the current implementation, `Meeting` is related to `Group` by composition. To facilitate the meeting feature, `Group` implements the following operations:

* `Group#hasMeeting` -- This returns `true` if there is a meeting associated with the group.
* `Group#getMeeting()` -- This group's meeting or `null` if the group has no meeting.
* `Group#setMeeting(Meeting meeting)` -- This assigns `meeting` to the group.
* `Group#cancelMeeting()` -- This removes the meeting associated witht the group.

These operations can be accessed by retreiving the list of groups using `Model#getGroupList()` and performing these operations on its members.

**Given below is an example usage scenario and how the model behaves at each step.**

Step 1. The user launches the application. For simplicity, we assume that the groups `Project2103`, `Presentation` and `FrisbeeTeam` are present in the meeting book. None of these groups have a meeting scheduled.

image::meetCommandStep1Diagram.png[width="600"]

[NOTE]
Meeting field in a group without a meeting is an empty `Optional`

Step 2. The user executes `meet FrisbeeTeam n/Sunday Practice t/28-10-2018@10:00 l/UTown Green d/Practice for Inter-College Games` to schedule a meeting named `Sunday Practice` associated with the group `FrisbeeTeam`.

image::meetCommandStep2Diagram.png[width="600"]

Step 3. The user then executes `meet Project2103 n/Weekly Meeting...` to schedule a meeting called `Weekly Meeting` with the `Project2103` Group.

image::meetCommandStep3Diagram.png[width="600"]

Step 4. The user then found out that the meeting `Sunday Practice` with `FrisbeeTeam` has been cancelled. Thus, the user calls `cancel FrisbeeTeam` to cancel meeting with the `FrisbeeTeam` group.

image::meetCommandStep4Diagram.png[width="600"]

[NOTE]
Calling `cancel` on a group without meeting returns an error

[NOTE]
calling `meet GROUP_NAME` without argument is equivalent to calling `cancel GROUP_NAME`.

Step 5. The user then discovers that the topic of the meeting with `Project2103` changed to rehearsal for the upcoming software demo. Therefore, the user calls `meet Project2103 n/Demo Preparation...` to change the detail of the meeting This overwrites the meeting `Weekly Meeting` with the new meeting `Demo Preparation`.

image::meetCommandStep5Diagram.png[width="600"]

[NOTE]
This operation creates a new `Meeting` object which replaces the old one.

**The following sequence diagrams show how the meet and cancel command function.**

.Sequence diagram for meet command
image::MeetCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="300"]

.Sequence diagram for cancel command
image::cancelCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="300"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of meetings

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Storing meetings inside groups
** Pros: This design simplifies the source code by not requiring a separate class to store meetings.
** Cons: This design requires iterating through all groups to retreive the list of meetings

* **Alternative 2:** Storing meetings in a separate uniqueMeetingList class
** Pros: This design simplifies retreival of the list of meetings.
** Cons: This design causes the code becomes more complicated and more difficult to test.

===== Aspect: Specification of target group for meet and cancel commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Specifying the group using its name.
** Pros: This design makes the command syntax natural and intuitive.
** Cons: This design forces the user have to manually type in the group name.

* **Alternative 2:** Specifying the group using its index.
** Pros: This design is easier to use when the number of groups is high.
** Cons: This design causes the command syntax to become unnatural, and makes the program more suspectible to errors.
// end::meeting[]

// tag::addressbook[]
=== MeetingBook feature

==== Current Implementation

.The object diagram of MeetingBook
image::addressbookObject.png[width="350"]

*Enhancements:*

* `versionedMeetingBook` now also contains group list and meeting list, which supports categorisation of persons in MeetingBook.
* `Group` can be created or removed from the MeetingBook.
* `Meeting` can be scheduled or cancelled from the MeetingBook.
* When a `Group` is removed from the MeetingBook, all members will be removed from this group.
* When a `Person` is removed from the MeetingBook, all groups containing this person as member will remove this person from the group.

[NOTE]
The categorisation of `Person` is not exclusive. One `Person` can be enrolled in multiple groups at the same time.
// end::addressbook[]

// tag::sortfind[]
=== Sort and Find feature

The Sort and Find commands modifies the `ObservableList<Person>` in `Model` that the UI is bound to. This section will
detail how the sort and find commands are implemented.

==== `sort` command usage

include::UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

==== `find` command usage

include::UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

==== Implementation of `sort` and `find` commands

`ModelManager` maintains a `sortedPersons` list of type `SortedList<Person>` and a `filteredPersons` list of type
`FilteredList<Person>`. +

Illustrated in the figure below, `sortedPersons` list wraps the `filteredPersons` list and
`filteredPersons` list wraps the `persons` list of type `ObservableList<Person>` maintained by `versionedMeetingBook`.
`persons` list in `versionedMeetingBook` contains all the persons stored in the MeetingBook.

image::sortedList-filteredList-persons.png[width="400"]

The list displayed in the UI is bound to the `sortedPersons` list. Hence, the `persons` list has two layers of
modification before being displayed in the GUI as `sortedPersons`. +

Before the user executes any `find` or `sort` commands, no `Comparator<Person>` and no `Predicate<Person>` is applied to
the `persons` list. The UI will display the all the persons in the MeetingBook as expected. +

When the user executes a `find` command, an appropriate `Predicate<Person>` will be created based on the user's input,
and the `Predicate<Person>` will be applied to the `persons` list. This modification will be reflected in the
`sortedPersons` list and in the displayed list in the GUI. +

Similarly, when a user executes a `sort` command, an appropriate `Comparator<Person>` will be applied to the
`filteredPersons` list. This modification will be reflected in the displayed list in the UI.

==== Design considerations

Due to this two-layered structure. The user can chain `find` and `sort` commands back-to-back to display the desired
list.
// end::sortfind[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedMeetingBook`.
It extends `MeetingBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `meetingBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedMeetingBook#commit()` -- Saves the current MeetingBook state in its history.
* `VersionedMeetingBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous MeetingBook state from its history.
* `VersionedMeetingBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone MeetingBook state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitMeetingBook()`, `Model#undoMeetingBook()` and `Model#redoMeetingBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedMeetingBook` will be initialized with the initial MeetingBook state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single MeetingBook state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the MeetingBook. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitMeetingBook()`, causing the modified state of the MeetingBook after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `meetingBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted MeetingBook state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitMeetingBook()`, causing another modified MeetingBook state to be saved into the `meetingBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitMeetingBook()`, so the MeetingBook state will not be saved into the `meetingBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoMeetingBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous MeetingBook state, and restores the MeetingBook to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial MeetingBook state, then there are no previous MeetingBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoMeetingBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoMeetingBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the MeetingBook to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `meetingBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest MeetingBook state, then there are no undone MeetingBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoMeetingBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the MeetingBook, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitMeetingBook()`, `Model#undoMeetingBook()` or `Model#redoMeetingBook()`. Thus, the `meetingBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitMeetingBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `meetingBookStateList`, all MeetingBook states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire MeetingBook.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of MeetingBook states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedMeetingBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::select[]
=== Select feature

The select command selects the `GroupCard`, `MeetingCard` or `PersonCard` in the `ObservableList<Group>`, `ObservableList<Meeting>`,
or `ObservableList<Person>` respectively in `Model` that is bounded to the UI. This section will explain current implementation
of select command, execution sequence, and design considerations of multiple implementations.

==== Current Implementation

The select mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`.
It extends `Model` with three lists, `UniquePersonList`, `UniqueMeetingList` and `UniqueGroupList` and implements the following operations:

* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList` -- Updates person list with a specific `Predicate`.
* `Model#updateFilteredGroupList` -- Updates group list with specific `Predicate`.
* `Model#updateFilteredMeetingList` -- Updates meeting list with specific `Predicate`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the select mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `ModelManager` will be initialized with the initial MeetingBook state, and `UniquePersonList`, `UniqueMeetingList` and `UniqueGroupList` contains all person, meetings and groups respectively without filter.

Step 2. The user executes `select` command to select the item type with the specified index in the MeetingBook.
The `SelectCommandParser` parses the command to determine the select type, and the command calls executes the following steps:

* Step 2.1. If the select type is `SELECT_TYPE_GROUP`, a `JumpToGroupListRequestEvent` is sent to update the UI to select the group card,
`Model#updateFilteredPersonList` is called to filter `UniquePersonList` to contain only person that are associated with the group,
and `Model#updateFilteredMeetingList` is called to filter `UniqueMeetingList` to show only meeting that is associated with the group.

* Step 2.2. If the select type is `SELECT_TYPE_MEETING`, a `JumpToMeetingListRequestEvent` is sent to the UI to select the meeting card.

* Step 2.3. If the select type is `SELECT_TYPE_PERSON`, a `JumpToListRequestEvent` is sent to the UI to select the person card.

[NOTE]
If a group is selected, subsequent `select` calls to person and meeting list will only select the person or meeting in the filtered
`UniquePersonList` or `UniqueMeetingList` respectively.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the select command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use prefix to differentiate between selecting group, meeting or person, and use a
single select class to perform all select operations.
** Pros: Easy to implement as there are fewer lines of code required.
** Cons: Harder to extend if need to implement select command for other items, select class will become bloated if too
many items require select command.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command for selecting group, meeting and person.
** Pros: Easy to extend functionality to select other items as all select commands are independent.
** Cons: Requires more code to implement.
* **Alternative 3:** Abstract select class containing required variables and methods without implementation, and select
commands inherit from the abstract class and implement the execution functionality.
** Pros: Good data structure.
** Cons: Requires more code to implement.
// end::select[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export feature
==== Current Implementation
===== Overview
The export mechanism is facilitated by `ExportCommand`. `ExportCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the input arguments. The end result of this command is a Xtensible Markup Language (XML) file containing data of MeetingBook when is executed successfully. +
[NOTE]
If there is no filepath provided, `export` command will return an invalid message, which the usage information to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how export operation works:

.Sequence diagram of ExportCommand
image::exportCommandSeqDiagram.png[width="1000"]

The program will raise a `MeetingBookExportEvent` to `EventCenter`. `StorageManager` which subscribed to the `EventCenter` will trigger `StorageManager#handleMeetingBookExportEvent` when received `MeetingBookExportEvent`.
This method will then attempt to export the data as a XML file using `Model#exportMeetingBook`.

===== Export to a XML file
Translation from MeetingBook to XML formatted file is handled by `XmlFileStorage#saveDataToFile`.
As MeetingBook stores `Person`, `Group`, `Meeting` as ``Object``s, these information have to be properly formatted into Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB)-friendly version before it can be successfully saved.
``Object``s are modelled using their respective `XMLAdapted` classes which contain directions for it to parse into JAXB-friendly version. `Marshal` Object will then marshal all the JAXB-friendly version of `Person`, `Meeting`, `Group` and assemble it into a XML file.

.Class diagram of XmlAdapted classes and their associations
image::xmlAdaptedClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Make export undoable
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Does not allow it to be undo.
** Pros: Easy to implement and verify if the command is executed successfully.
** Cons: User have to manually navigate through the directory to delete the XML file to achieve the same result as undoing the command.

* **Alternative 2: ** Allow it to be undoable.
** Pros: Allow user to undo the command.
** Cons: Make it difficult to implement as there is a need to consider on how to resolve the following scenarios:
*** After user export data, user may directly make changes to the XML file exported. Does undoing the operation deletes the file or not since it have been modified after the export command?
*** After user export data, user rename the XML file or move the XML file. This causes the original file referenced by the `export` command to be lost and unable to continue the undo operation.

+
These scenarios create unnecessary complications when we want to attempt undoing the operation. Therefore, we choose to not allow the command to be undoable.

// end::export[]

// tag::import[]
=== Import feature
==== Current Implementation
===== Overview
The import command allow the user to import a XML file containing of MeetingBook data into his MeetingBook.
This is facilitated by is facilitated by `ImportCommand`. `ImportCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the input arguments.
The end result of this command is entries of `Person`, `Group`, `Meeting` added into the current MeetingBook.

===== Import from XML file
Translation from XML formatted file to `MeetingBook` is handled by `XmlFileStorage#loadDataToFile`.
As MeetingBook consists `Person`, `Group`, `Meeting` as ``Object``s, these information have to be properly formatted back into Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB)-friendly version before it can then modelled into its respective classes (i.e. `xmlAdaptedPerson` modelled back into `Person` object).
Each ``Object``s has their respective `XMLAdapted` class which contain directions to model back from JAXB-friendly version . `Unmarshal` Object is solely responsible for disassemble the XML file into  JAXB-friendly versions of `Person`, `Meeting`, `Group`, which will then be feed as parameters to create another instance of `MeetingBook`.
The imported `MeetingBook` will then merge with the current `MeetingBook` using `MeetingBook#merge`.

.Class diagram of XmlAdapted classes and their associations
image::xmlAdaptedClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Handling of conflict files
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Either ignore or overwrite conflicting files.
*** Pros: Easy to handle conflicting cases.
*** Cons: Loss of data as information is destroyed or lost when importing.
When we choose to ignore, we lose data from the XML file as they are not imported in.
If we were to overwrite conflicting files, we lose information in our current MeetingBook as they are overwritten by the imported data.
* **Alternative 2:**  Append an arbitrary number to the name of `Person`/`Group`.
*** Pros: No loss of data when importing.
*** Cons: End up with lots of data with arbitrary number appended to it.
This may cause confusion to the user as there is many similar entries of the `Person`/`Group` object only to  be differ by an arbitrary number.
This will also cause `find` command to not work as expected. `find` command currently matches exact search term and the arbitrary number appended cause it to no longer match the name of the `Object`.
// end::import[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.meeting.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.meeting.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.meeting.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.meeting.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, MeetingBook depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/logic/parser/MeetingBookParser.java[`MeetingBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/logic/parser/MeetingBookParser.java[`MeetingBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the MeetingBook, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the MeetingBook.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/MeetingBook.java[`MeetingBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/MeetingBook.java[`MeetingBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/MeetingBook.java[`MeetingBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/MeetingBook.java[`MeetingBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `MeetingBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/book-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your MeetingBook application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/MeetingBookSystemTest.java[`MeetingBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and MeetingBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the MeetingBook is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleMeetingBookChangedEvent(MeetingBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the MeetingBook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/MeetingBookSystemTest.java[`MeetingBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the MeetingBook to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the MeetingBook after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the MeetingBook storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupMeetingBook(ReadOnlyMeetingBook)`, so that the MeetingBook can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/storage/MeetingBookStorage.java[`MeetingBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/storage/XmlMeetingBookStorage.java[`XmlMeetingBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `MeetingBook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/logic/parser/MeetingBookParser.java[`MeetingBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/meeting/logic/parser/MeetingBookParserTest.java[`MeetingBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/logic/parser/MeetingBookParser.java[`MeetingBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/meeting/logic/parser/MeetingBookParserTest.java[`MeetingBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `meetingBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonMeetingBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsMeetingBook.xml`, `validMeetingBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/meeting/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/meeting/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/meeting/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/meeting/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
