== Introduction
Welcome to ThanePark!
The purpose of this documentation is to assist you in your transition to begin developmental work on ThanePark.

If you are a developer looking to adopt ThanePark for your own uses, go to <<Setting up, *`Setting up`*>>.

If you wish to contribute to ThanePark, go to <<Dev Ops, *`Developing the application`*>>.

If you wish to update documentation of ThanePark, go to <<Documentation,*`Documentation`*>>.

== About
ThanePark is a desktop application for theme park management. The application is optimized for keyboard-oriented
users and retains user-friendly graphics that informs users of their decisions in a glance.

== Setting up
Before you get started on development on the application, you will need to complete the following steps below.

=== Checking Software Prerequisites
To ensure a smooth transition into your development, check that the following software versions are installed:

* *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

* *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer
After you have installed the correct software, follow the steps below to setup your development environment locally:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zone/storage/XmlAdaptedRide.java[`XmlAdaptedRide.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zone/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors.
Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/zone/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`]
and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/zone/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)
+
[WARNING]
Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error

=== Verifying the Setup
It is recommended that you verify the setup by trying the following actions:

. Run the `seedu.thanepark.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configuring your Integrated Development Environment
Some configurations of your Integrated Development Environment need to be set:

==== Configuring the coding style
This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order
+
[Tips]
* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork
After you fork the repo, the documentation will still have the CS2103-W14-2 branding and refer to the `CS2103-W14-2/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-W14-2/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI
Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding
When you are ready to start coding:

* Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
* Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

This section will help you better understand the software architecture of ThanePark.
[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="800"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
It shows the various interactions between <<Design-Main,*`Main`*>> and 4 other components:
<<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>, <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>,
<<Design-Model,*`Model`*>> and <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>,
Given below is a quick overview of each component:

[[Design-Main]]
=== Main component

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zone/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

* *`Commons`* represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

** `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
** `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.


* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ThaneParkChangedEvent` when the Thane Park data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The `UI` component is responsible for any UI-related functionality of the App.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zone/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RideListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zone/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The `Logic` component is responsible for handling and executing command logic.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zone/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ThaneParkParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a ride) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The `Model` component stores an internal representation of the state of the application in memory.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zone/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Thane Park data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Ride>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Thane Park`, which `Ride` can reference. This would allow `Thane Park` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Ride` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The `Storage` component is responsible for reading data from, and writing data to, the hard disk.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zone/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Thane Park data in xml format and read it back.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::filter[]

=== Filter Feature

This section documents how `filter` is implemented and how it works.

==== Current Implementation
The execution of the `filter` command is simple and linear as the following activity diagram would show:

.Activity Diagram for the Filter Feature
image::FilterActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram will show how the `filter` command works: +

.Sequence Diagram for the Filter Feature
image::FilterSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The feature is implemented with the help of `FilterCommand` and `AttributePredicate` class. When the
`ThaneParkParser` parses the user input and finds the filter command word `filter` it calls a new `FilterCommandParser` to
parse the arguments from the user input.

It checks if there are any of the maintenance or waiting time prefix in the arguments. If any of the prefixes are present,
an `AttributePredicate` is created with the operator (‘<', ‘>’, '< =' or '> =' or '==') and the `NumericAttribute` they
are checking for (ie `Maintenance` or `WaitTime`). The ``AttributePredicate``s are added to a list. The user can add any
amount of predicates that they want, like 3 predicates e.g. `filter w/< 50 w/ > 5 m/>10` and the list would contain 3
predicates and if the user decides to input only one predicate, the list will only contain one. +

A new `RideContainsConditionPredicate` is instantiated with the list of ``AttributePredicate``s. The `FilterCommandParser` will
return a new `FilterCommand` with the `RideContainsConditionPredicate` in it.

The `LogicManager` executes the command, and the `RideContainsConditionPredicate` will be set as the predicate to filter
the list of rides and it will check if the ride fulfils the required predicate(s). The `RideContainsConditionPredicate`
will test if each ride fulfills the required conditions using this method:

[source,java]
----
    public boolean test(Ride ride) {
        return attributePredicates.stream().allMatch(p -> {
            NumericAttribute attributeToTest = p.getAttribute();
            NumericAttribute rideAttributeToTest = ride.getAttribute(attributeToTest);
            return p.test(rideAttributeToTest);
        });
    }
----
So it should be pretty simple to add new ``NumericAttribute``s to the rides like ratings if you wish to with minimal
changes to other classes, as long as relevant methods are added to `FilterCommandParser` to handle the new ``NumericAttribute``s.
After all of the rides in the application are tested, a list of filtered rides would be returned and shown to the user.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support filter commands
* **Alternative 1(Current Choice):** Abstract attributes that contain numeric values into a separate class and create a
AttributePredicate to test the attribute
** Pros: More numeric attributes can be easily added  and minimal changes are required to filter new attributes
** Cons: More classes would need to be implemented to handle this feature

* **Alternative 2:** Give the entire string condition to the RideContainsConditionPredicate to test.
** Pros: Classes do not need to abstracted, and thus would be easier to implement
** Cons: RideContainsConditionPredicate would carry out parsing functions which would make it less cohesive

// end::filter[]

=== Command Management Feature

// tag::commandManagement[]
==== Current Implementation

The Command Management feature is responsible for making ThanePark application easier to use.
It can be decomposed into the following segments: +

* <<accessibility_help, *Help*>>
* <<accessibility_autocomplete, *Autocomplete*>>
* <<accessibility_history, *Command History retrieval*>>

[#accessibility_help]
===== Help
The *help* mechanism is facilitated by the `ShowHelpRequestEvent`.
When the user executes a `HelpCommand`, the required level of help is encoded in `ShowHelpRequest`.
This event type is subscribed to by `MainWindow`, which will load the respective help page in the required window
(`BrowserPanel` or `HelpWindow`). Most of these classes belong to the User Interface (UI) component.
These interactions are illustrated in the class diagram below:

.Class Diagram of help mechanism
image::HelpClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[#accessibility_autocomplete]
===== Autocomplete
The *autocomplete* mechanism is facilitated by `SuggestCommand`.
It extends `Command` and serves as a special kind of `Command` that cannot be directly invoked by the `LogicManager`.
A new instance of `SuggestCommand` is created whenever `ThaneParkParser` fails to find a matching CommandWord,
or when kbd:[TAB] is pressed inside the *Command Box*. See the 2 figures below:

.Activity Diagram of user executing command
image::AutocompleteSuggestActivityDiagram1.png[width="800"]

.Activity Diagram of user pressing tab
image::AutocompleteSuggestActivityDiagram2.png[width="800"]

The application will then proceed with executing the `SuggestCommand`, which returns prefix-matched `Command` s.
These matching `Command` s are reflected in both `CommandResult` and `ShowHelpRequestEvent`, which will in turn update
`ResultDisplay` and `CommandBox` text. See figure below:

.Activity Diagram of user pressing tab
image::AutocompleteSuggestActivityDiagram3.png[width="800"]

You can easily add other pattern matching heuristics such as `nearest word distance` by implementing the following interface, `PatternMatcher`:
[source,java]
----
public interface PatternMatcher {
    /**
     * Matches a list of items as Strings against a given pattern.
     */
    public String[] matchPattern(String[] items, String pattern);
}
----
A possible implementation of a prefix matcher is shown below:
[source,java]
----
public class PrefixMatcher implements PatternMatcher {
    private static final String PATTERN_PREFIX = "^%1$s.*";
    /**
     * Default constructor
     */
    public PrefixMatcher() {
        ;
    }

    @Override
    public String[] matchPattern(String[] items, String pattern) {
        return Arrays.stream(items).filter(s
            -> s.matches(String.format(PATTERN_PREFIX, pattern))).toArray(String[]::new);
    }

}
----


[#accessibility_history]
===== History
The *history* mechanism is facilitated by `CommandHistory` and `CommandsLogCenter`.
`CommandHistory` maintains the history as a list of user inputs during the session,
and interfaces with `CommandsLogCenter` to handle the retrieval and persistent storage
of user inputs executed across sessions.

Given below are 2 example usage scenarios to illustrate the behavior of the *history* mechanism.

* Example scenario 1: User requests for current session's history. +
Step 1. User executes `history`. +
Step 2. The list of user inputs in the current session is retrieved from `CommandHistory`. +
Step 3. A `NewResultAvailableEvent` is raised within the `Logic` component.
Step 4. The result panel displays the list of user inputs upon notification by the event.

* Example scenario 2: User requests for cumulative history. +

When the cumulative history of all commands is requested through `history more` command, a `HTML` report is generated.
The process of generating a `HTML` report upon execution of `history more` is illustrated in the Sequence Diagram below.

.Sequence Diagram of HTML report generation since command
image::HistorySequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Handling UI interactions in help

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Subscribe `MainWindow` to `ShowHelpRequestEvent`.
** Pros: Cohesive. Every `UI` component affected by `ShowHelpRequestEvent` are handled through `MainWindow`.
** Cons: Difficult to implement. Interactions between `MainWindow` and its child `UI` components must be carefully handled.
Easy to cause bugs if not handled appropriately.
* **Alternative 2:** Subscribe `BrowserPanel`, `HelpWindow` and `RideListPanel` to `ShowHelpRequestEvent`.
** Pros: Easy to implement. These `UI` components can directly perform whatever is required.
** Cons: High dependency. When a modification to `ShowHelpRequestEvent` is required, all of these classes may need to be modified.

===== Aspect: Handling autocomplete text replacement

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Handle autocomplete text replacement through `SuggestCommandEvent`.
** Pros: Flexible. Easy to modify text replacement behavior through `SuggestCommandEvent`. Can be used by
both kbd:[Tab] and kbd:[Enter]. Open for extension to other keystrokes or actions that lead to autocompletion.
** Cons: Difficult to implement as it requires some understanding of the `EventsCenter` and handling of the various
Event types in the application.
* **Alternative 2:** Handle autocomplete through the existing `NewResultAvailableEvent`.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Can modify `NewResultAvailableEvent` to easily satisfy most requirements.
** Cons: Difficult to extend. When modifying behavior of text autocompletion, modification of
both `CommandBox` and `ResultDisplay` may be required.

===== Aspect: Storing command history

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store every command entry in a separate xml file.
** Pros: Flexible. Able to format the file with little constraint to meet storage requirements.
** Cons: Low code reuse. Does not utilise the existing `LogsCenter` for ThanePark.
* **Alternative 2:** Store command entries using the existing `LogsCenter` for ThanePark.
** Pros: High code reuse. Developers know that all logging within the ThanePark is done by `LogsCenter`.
** Cons: High dependency and difficult to implement. When a modification to `LogsCenter` is required,
the modification of command history storage may be required. Additionally, the parsing of command history
from the existing `LogsCenter` logs may require substantial modifications.

// end::commandManagement[]

// tag::viewstatus[]
=== View Status Feature

This section documents how `viewstatus` is being implemented.

==== Current Implementation

The view status feature is implemented with the help of `ViewStatusCommand` and `RideStatusPredicate` classes.
As seen in the sequence diagram below, when the `ThaneParkParser` class parses the user input of `viewstatus`,
it calls a new `ViewStatusCommandParser` to parse the arguments from the user input.

.Sequence Diagram of the View Status feature
image::ViewStatusSequenceDiagram.png[width="550"]

.Activity Diagram of `ViewStatusCommandParser`
image::ViewStatusActivityDiagram.png[width="550"]

As seen in the diagram above, the `ViewStatusCommandParser` class checks the arguments for keywords relating to the status of the rides.
If there are more than one strings found or the argument string is not one of the three statuses,
it will throw a `ParseException`, letting the user know that the command format is wrong.
Conversely, it will compare the argument with the statuses and create a `Status` enumeration.

A new `RideStatusPredicate` is instantiated with the `Status` enumeration.
The `ViewStatusCommandParser` will return a new `ViewStatusCommand` containing `RideStatusPredicate`.

The `LogicManager` execute the command, and uses the `RideStatusPredicate` to filter the list of rides for rides that fulfill the required predicate(s).
A list of filtered rides would be returned.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support view status command
* **Alternative 1(Current choice):** Handle checking of status by passing the `Status` enumeration to `RideStatusPredicate` to test.
** Pros: Code is more cohesive as each class is more focused.
** Cons: More classes are required to implement the check.

* **Alternative 2:** Handle checking of status in ViewStatusCommand by using a lambda expression to express the predicate.
** Pros: Easier to implement as less classes are needed.
** Cons: Reduced modularity as predicate logic is not abstracted.

// end::viewstatus[]


// tag::open[]
=== Open/Shutdown Feature
This section documents how open/shutdown features are implemented and how they work. Note that `open` and `shutdown`
features are very similar to each other.

==== Current Implementation

The `OpenActivityDiagram` below show the execution flow of `OpenCommand`:

.Activity Diagram of `OpenCommand`
image::OpenActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram will show how the open/shutdown feature works: +

.Sequence Diagram for the Open Feature
image::OpenSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


As seen in the diagram above, the `open` function is implemented with the help of `OpenCommand` and
`UpdateRideDescriptor` class. When the `ThaneParkParser` parses the user input and finds the open command word `open`,
it calls a new `OpenCommandParser` to parse the arguments from the user input.

Next, the `OpenCommandParser` will parse the arguments from the user input into an `index` and
return a new `OpenCommand` with the `index` as the parameter.

Finally, the `LogicManager` will execute the `open` command, and the `index` will be used to find the `ride` from the
list.
After that, the `open` command will change the status of the ride to `Open` by utilising the `UpdateRideDescriptor`
class.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support open/shutdown commands
* **Alternative 1(Current choice):** Change the status of the ride inside the `open` command and include the
    `UpdateRideDescriptor` in the `open` command as well.
** Pros: This would be easier to implement as `UpdateRideDescriptor` class no need to abstracted out from the
   `openCommand` class.

** Cons: `UpdateRideDescriptor` will modify the status of rides inside the `openCommand` class which will make the
   `openCommand` class less cohesive.

* **Alternative 2:** Abstracting `UpdateRideDescriptor` into a separate class and modify the status of rides in the
    separate class instead of `openCommand` class.
** Pros: The `openCommand` will be more cohesive.
** Cons: More classes would need to be implemented to modify the status of rides.
// end::open[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedThanePark`.
It extends `ThanePark` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `ThaneParkStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedThanePark#commit()` -- Saves the current zone book state in its history.
* `VersionedThanePark#undo()` -- Restores the previous zone book state from its history.
* `VersionedThanePark#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone zone book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitThanePark()`, `Model#undoThanePark()` and `Model#redoThanePark()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedThanePark` will be initialized with the initial zone book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single zone book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th ride in the zone book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitThanePark()`, causing the modified state of the zone book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `ThaneParkStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted zone book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new ride. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitThanePark()`, causing another modified zone book state to be saved into the `ThaneParkStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitThanePark()`, so the zone book state will not be saved into the `ThaneParkStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the ride was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoThanePark()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous zone book state, and restores the zone book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial zone book state, then there are no previous zone book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoThanePark()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoThanePark()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the zone book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `ThaneParkStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest zone book state, then there are no undone zone book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoThanePark()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the zone book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitThanePark()`, `Model#undoThanePark()` or `Model#redoThanePark()`. Thus, the `ThaneParkStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitThanePark()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `ThaneParkStateList`, all zone book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire zone book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the ride being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of zone book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedThanePark`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).


== Documentation

Asciidoc was used for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

[TIP]
If you need to edit the diagrams found in this document, the `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can
be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

This section covers what you need to know about running and designing automated tests for further development on this application.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.thanepark.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.thanepark.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.thanepark.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.thanepark.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zone/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Thane Park depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
