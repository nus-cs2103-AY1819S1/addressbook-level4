== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/storage/XmlAdaptedWish.java[`XmlAdaptedWish.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/url/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/url/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.url.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-1/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-1/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteWish.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `WishBookChangedEvent` when the Wish Book data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk. This event also triggers the save of wish histories to disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteWishEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `WishListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `WishBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a wish) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Wish Book data.
* stores the data of wish histories.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Wish>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. The elements of the `ObservableList<Wish>` can also
be filtered and sorted to suit the needs of specific commands.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Wish Book`, which `Wish` can reference. This would allow `Wish Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Wish` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Wish Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.wishbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Model
==== Wish Model
A wish is uniquely identified by its Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) which is generated randomly only once for a
particular wish, upon its creation through the `AddCommand`. A wish stores the following primary attributes:

* Name
* Price
* Date
* Saved Amount
* Url
* Remark
* Tags
* UUID

[NOTE]
It is impossible for the user to create a duplicate wish as it is impossible to modify a wish's UUID.

==== Wish Priority
A wish needs to be prioritised in a specific order such that the wishes with the highest priority will be visible
on the top of the list. In WishBook, the priority is determined primarily by the due date of the wish which is
stored in every wish's `Date` attribute. Ties are broken by `Name`. Further ties are broken by `UUID` as it is possible
for the `Date` and `Name` of two wishes to be identical.

The sorting of the displayed results is done by the `filteredSortedWishes` list. The sorting order is specified by
`WishComparator`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Uniqueness of a Wish
* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Identify a `Wish` by a randomly generated UUID.
** Pros: Extremely low probability of collision.
** Pros: No extra maintenance required upon generation as every `Wish` is unique.
** Cons: UUID does not map to any real world entity and it is used strictly for identification.
** Cons: It is more difficult to system test the `AddCommand` with the current group of methods for system tests as
UUID is randomly generated each time.

* **Alternative 2:** Identify a wish by `Name`, `Price`, `Date`, `Url`, `Tags`. Wishes with identical values for
these attributes will be represented by a single `WishCard`. The `WishCard` will be augmented with a `Multiplicity` to
indicate the number of identical wishes.
** Pros: WishBook will be more compact and every attribute stored in a `Wish` maps to a real entity.
** Cons: Additional attribute `Multiplicity` may have to be frequently edited as it is another
attribute that is affected by multiple commands.

* **Alternative 3:** Identify a wish by a new attribute `CreatedTime`, which is derived from the system time
when the wish is created.
** Pros: The attribute maps to a real entity. It can be an additional information presented to the user about a wish.
** Cons: There might be collisions in `CreatedTime` if the the system time is incorrect.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedWishBook`.
It extends `WishBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `wishBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedWishBook#commit()` -- Saves the current wish book state in its history.
* `VersionedWishBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous wish book state from its history.
* `VersionedWishBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone wish book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitWishBook()`, `Model#undoWishBook()` and `Model#redoWishBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedWishBook` will be initialized with the initial wish book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single url book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th wish in the wish book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitWishBook()`, causing the modified state of the url book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `wishBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted url book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new wish. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitWishBook()`, causing another modified wish book state to be saved into the `wishBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitWishBook()`, so the wish book state will not be saved into the `wishBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the wish was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoWishBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous wish book state, and restores the url book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial wish book state, then there are no previous url book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoWishBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoWishBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the wish book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `wishBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest wish book state, then there are no undone url book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoWishBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the wish book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitWishBook()`, `Model#undoWishBook()` or `Model#redoWishBook()`. Thus, the `wishBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitWishBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `wishBookStateList`, all wish book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire wish book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the wish being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of wish book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedWishBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::savingsHistory[]
=== Savings History feature
==== Capturing the state of `WishTransaction`

The current state of the savings history of the `WishBook` is captured by `VersionedWishTransaction`.
`VersionedWishTransaction` extends `WishTransaction` and has an undo/redo history, similar to the implementation of the Undo/Redo feature, and is stored internally as a `wishStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements `VersionedModel` and so contains the implementation of the following operations:

* `VersionedWishTransaction#commit()` -- Saves the current wish transaction state in its history.
* `VersionedWishTransaction#undo()` -- Restores the previous wish transaction state from its history.
* `VersionedWishTransaction#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone wish transaction state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitWishBook()`, `Model#undoWishBook()` and `Model#redoWishBook()` respectively.

==== Capturing the state of each `Wish`

`WishTransaction` keeps track of the state of all wishes in `WishBook` via a `wishMap` which maps the unique ID of a `Wish` to a list of `Wish` states. `WishTransaction` implements `ActionCommandListener` such that any state changing command performed to a `Wish` or the `WishBook` such as `AddCommand()`, `EditCommand()`, `SaveCommand()`, etc will result in the `WishMap` being updated accordingly in `WishTransaction`.

==== Persistent storage

`VersionedWishTransaction`, `WishTransaction` can be easily converted to and from xml using  `XmlWishTransactions`. `XmlWishTransactions` is saved as an xml file when the user explicitly closes the window, thereby invoking `MainApp#stop()` which saves the current state of `VersionedWishTransaction` in the `wishStateList` to hard disk.

If the user's command triggers a change in the state of the `WishBook`, a `WishBookChangedEvent` will be raised, causing the subscribed `StorageManager` to respond by saving both the current state of the `WishBook` and `WishTransaction` to disk.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the savings history mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The default file path storing the previous state of the `WishTransaction` will be retrieved, unless otherwise specified by the user, and the contents from the xml file will be parsed and converted into a `WishTransaction` object via the `XmlWishTransactions` object. If the file at the specified location is behind the current state of the `WishBook`, content of the `WishTransaction` will be overwritten by the `WishBook`.

[NOTE]
The `wishStateList` starts off with the initial state of the `WishTransaction` as the first item in the list.

Step 2. The user executes `add n/iPhone ...` to add a new wish. The `add` command calls `Model#commitWishBook()`, causing the current state of the modified wish transaction state to be saved into `wishStateList`. As this is a command that changes the state of the `WishBook`, `Model#addWish()` will call `VersionedWishTransaction#addWish()` to add a new wish to the `WishMap`.

[NOTE]
* If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitWishBook()`, so the wish transaction state will not be saved into the `wishStateList`.
* If the `WishMap` contains an identical wish (such is identified by `Wish#isSameWish()`), then the call to add this wish will fail. As such, the wish will not be added to the `WishMap` or the `WishBook`.

Step 3. The user now decides that adding the wish was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoWishBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous wish transaction state, and restores the wish transaction to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial wish transaction state, then there are no previous wish transaction states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoWishBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoWishBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the wish transaction to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `wishStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest wish transaction state, then there are no undone wish transaction states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoWishBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 4. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the state of the `WishBook`, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitWishBook()`, `Model#undoWishBook()` or `Model#redoWishBook()`. Thus, the `wishBookStateList` remains unchanged.

Step 5. The user finally exits the app by clicking on the close button. The most recent state of the `WishTransaction` will be converted into xml format via the the `XmlWishTransactions` object and be saved into the same file path it was first retrieved from.

[NOTE]
If there was some error saving the current state of the `WishTransaction` to the specified file path in hard disk, an exception will be thrown and a warning will be shown to the user. The current state of the `WishTransaction` object will not be saved to hard disk.
// end::savingsHistory[]

// tag::wish[]
=== Add Wish feature

==== Current Implementation

The Add Wish feature is executed through an `AddCommand` by the user, which after parsing,
is facilitated mainly by the `ModelManager` which implements `Model`.
It also affects `versionedWishBook` and `versionedWishTransaction` by adding the target wish to both of their respective data structures.
After adding a `Wish`, the `filteredSortedWishes` is also updated to reflect the latest WishBook.
The UI is also prompted to refresh through a `WishBookChangedEvent`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how an AddCommand is carried out.

Step 1. The user types in a valid `AddCommand`, for example, `add n/1 TB Toshiba SSD p/158 d/200d`, and the current date is 2nd October 2017 (2/10/2017).

[NOTE]
* The Date format should be `dd/mm/yyyy` where the specified date should be a valid date in the future.
* If the date provided after the date prefix `d/` is of valid duration length instead of `dd/mm/yyyy` format, the format should be `<years>y<months>m<days>d`.
* If an invalid date is provided, a warning will be displayed to prompt the user to enter a valid date.

The `AddCommandParser` will employ `ParserUtil` to parse the attributes specified after each prefix. The parsing of the
`Date` attribute which follows `d/` in the command will be discussed below.

The computation of wish expiry date is handled internally in the `ParserUtil` class,
which is able to take days, months, and years as input to generate a proper `Date` with the current date that the user executes the command.
Internally, `ParserUtil#parseDate()` converts the input date specified, and adds it to the current date to get the desired `Date`.

The resultant wish will have the following properties:

* Name: _1TB Toshiba SSD_
* SavedAmount: 0
* Price: 158.00
* Date: 20/4/2018 (20th April 2018)
* URL: `empty string`
* Remark: `empty string`
* Tags: `none`
* Transactions: `empty LinkedList`

Step 2. The resultant wish is pass into `VersionedWishBook#addWish` and `VersionedWishTransaction#addWish`,
which tracks the history of the `WishBook` and `Wish` respectively. The list of wishes shown on the UI is also updated to show all wishes again,
as `filteredSortedWishes` is updated to have all wishes in `WishBook` and a `WishBookChangedEvent` is fired.

==== Design Considerations

// end::wish[]

// tag::save[]
=== Save Amount feature

==== Current Implementation

The Save Amount feature is executed through a `SaveCommand` by the user, which after parsing,
is facilitated mainly by the `ModelManager` which implements `Model`.
Wish stores the `price` and `savedAmount` of `Wish`, helping to track the progress of the savings towards the `price`.
Meanwhile, WishBook stores an `unusedFunds`, which is an unallocated pool of funds that can be used in the future.
After adding a saving, the `filteredSortedWishes` in `ModelManager` is updated to reflect the latest observable WishBook.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the SaveCommand behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user executes `save 1 10`, to save $10 into an existing wish with `Index` 1 and `Price` $15. The $10 is
wrapped in an `Amount` and a `SaveCommand` instance is created with the `Amount`. `Amount` is then used to make an updated
instance of the `Wish` at index 1 whose `SavedAmount` will be updated. `Model#updateWish` is then called to update this
wish with the old one in `WishBook`.

[NOTE]
The `Index` of each `Wish` is labelled at the side of the app.

The resultant wish will have the following properties:

* Name: _1TB Toshiba SSD_
* SavedAmount: 10.00
* Price: 15.00
* DueDate: 20/4/2018 (20th April 2018)
* URL: `empty string`
* Remark: `empty string`
* Tags: `none`
* Transactions: `empty LinkedList`
* Fulfilled: `false`
* Expired: `false`

[NOTE]
`Amount` can be a negative value where it would mean a withdrawal of money from a particular wish.

[NOTE]
`SavedAmount` of a wish cannot be negative. This means that an `Amount` cannot be negative enough to cause `SavedAmount`
to be negative.

Step 2. The user decides to execute `save 1 10` again. However, SaveCommand checks that `savedAmount` > `price`.
SaveCommand#execute creates a new updated `Wish` with `savedAmount = wish.getPrice()`.

The resultant wish will have the following properties:

* Name: _1TB Toshiba SSD_
* SavedAmount: 15.00
* Price: 15.00
* DueDate: 20/4/2018 (20th April 2018)
* URL: `empty string`
* Remark: `empty string`
* Tags: `none`
* Transactions: `empty LinkedList`
* Fulfilled: `true`
* Expired: `false`

Step 3. The excess amount of $5 is stored in a new `Amount` variable `excess`.
SaveCommand#execute then calls Model#updateUnusedFunds(excess) to update the `unusedFunds` in WishBook.

In WishBook, the result would be:

* unusedFunds: 5.00

Step 4. The user tries to execute `save 1 10` again. However, since the value for Wish#isFulfilled is true, the amount
will not be saved. SaveCommand#execute will throw a CommandException, with the message "Wish has already been fulfilled!".

The following sequence diagram shows how the save operation works:

image::SaveCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Data structure to support the unusedFunds feature

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store it in a `SavedAmount` variable in `WishBook`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: More methods needed when needing to move funds from `unusedFunds` to other wishes.
* **Alternative 2:** Store it as a pseudo wish with index 0.
** Pros: It can be treated as another `wish`, hence existing methods can be used without needing to create much more new ones.
** Cons: Requires dealing with an extra wish that has to be hidden on the `WishListPanel` and displayed separately on the UI.
We must remember to skip this wish in methods that involve displaying the WishList.

// end::save[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find Wish Feature

==== Current Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommand` and `FindCommandParser`. It extends `Command` and implements the following operations.

* `FindCommand#execute()` -- Executes the command by running a predicate `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and updates the current wish list.

The find mechanism is supported by `FindCommandParser`. It implements `Parser` that contains the following operations.

* `FindCommandParser#parse()` -- Checks the arguments for empty strings and throws a `ParseException` if empty string is found. It then splits it by one or more white spaces. It then removes any strings in the list of common words.

The predicate `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` takes in a list of strings and checks if any of the strings contain fully or partial in the list of wish's name, and returns the corresponding wish if so.

_{TO-DO: Sequence Diagram here}_

==== Example

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `find iphone` command to get all wishses containing the word 'iphone'.
The `find` command calls `FindCommandParser#parse()`, checking the values `iphone`.

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `FindCommand#execute()`, so the state will not be saved.

Step 3. The entire list of wishes is filtered by the predicate `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

Step 4. The filtered list of wishes is returned to the GUI.

_{TO-DO: Flow Chart Diagram}_

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How predicate works

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Predicate have additional filter with an ignore list.
** Pros: Easy to implement, user friendly.
** Cons: More complicated predicate, sub strings not easily taken care of.

* **Alternative 2:** Filter the data when it is taken in.
** Pros: Less complicated predicate.
** Cons: Manipulates the data, editing it for every other case.

// end::find[]

// tag::savingsNotifications[]
=== [Proposed] Savings Notifications
==== Justification
Some users may have many wishes, all of which have a different targeted date of completion and different price.
It may thus be difficult for users to keep track of how much they need to consistently save to fulfil their various wishes on time.
This Savings Notification feature will allow users to opt for daily/weekly/monthly notifications for each specific wish,
reminding them of the amount that they need to save at the beginning of the chosen time period.
This will help users to consistently save towards their wishes.

// end::savingsNotifications[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.url.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.url.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.url.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.url.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Wish Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all wishes in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/logic/parser/WishBookParser.java[`WishBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/logic/parser/WishBookParser.java[`WishBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the wish book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the wish book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/WishBook.java[`WishBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/WishBook.java[`WishBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/wish/Wish.java[`Wish`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/WishBook.java[`WishBook`] allows you to update a wish, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/wish/Wish.java[`Wish`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/WishBook.java[`WishBook`]. Loop through each wish, and remove the `tag` from each wish.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `WishBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your wish book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a wish, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last wish in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside wish cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/WishCard.java[the `WishCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `WishCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/WishBookSystemTest.java[`WishBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and WishBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the wish book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of wishes when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleWishBookChangedEvent(WishBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of wishes whenever there are new changes to the wishbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/WishBookSystemTest.java[`WishBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of wishes status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the wish book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the url book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the url book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupWishBook(ReadOnlyWishBook)`, so that the wish book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/storage/WishBookStorage.java[`WishBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/storage/XmlWishBookStorage.java[`XmlWishBookStorage`] class.
* Solution

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `wishbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a wish specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Buying this for dad.` +
Edits the remark for the first wish to `Buying this for dad.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first wish.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/logic/parser/WishBookParser.java[`WishBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/url/logic/parser/WishBookParserTest.java[`WishBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Buying this for dad.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/logic/parser/WishBookParser.java[`WishBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/url/logic/parser/WishBookParserTest.java[`WishBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `WishCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/WishCard.java[`WishCard`] s to display a remark for each wish later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/WishListCard.fxml[`WishListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/WishCard.java[`WishCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/WishCardHandle.java[`WishCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/wish/Wish.java[`Wish`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/wish/Wish.java[`Wish`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Wish` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/wish/Wish.java[`Wish`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/wish/Wish.java[`Wish`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the wish will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `wishBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedWish` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Wish` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/storage/XmlAdaptedWish.java[`XmlAdaptedWish`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidWishWishBook.xml`, `typicalWishesWishBook.xml`, `validWishBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `WishBuilder`
Since `Wish` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/url/testutil/WishBuilder.java[`WishBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/model/wish/Wish.java[`Wish`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/url/testutil/WishBuilder.java[`WishBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the wish that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Wish` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/url/testutil/TypicalWishes.java[`TypicalWishes`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `WishCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/WishCard.java[`WishCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/url/ui/WishCard.java[`WishCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Wish` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/url/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysWish(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a wish.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
