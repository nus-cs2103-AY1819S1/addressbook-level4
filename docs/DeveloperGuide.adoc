== Introduction

Welcome to SocialCare's Developer Guide!

=== What is SocialCare?

SocialCare is a CLI-based event and volunteer management system designed for social welfare organisations. It enables the following:

* Faster volunteer and event management (than a typical mouse/GUI driven app).
* Tagging to categorize volunteers and events.
* Managing additional volunteer data, such as number of service hours per volunteer.
* Viewing of volunteer and event statistics.

=== Core team

SocialCare was developed and is maintained by https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W16-2[Team W16-2]. Due credit goes to the https://se-edu.github.io/docs/Team.html[se-edu] team, whose application https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[Address Book - Level 4] was morphed into SocialCare.

Feel free to <<ContactUs#, reach out>> to us regarding any enquiries or clarifications.

=== Contributing

SocialCare is an open source project, and thus contributions are always welcome. Let's get you on board!

To get started, head on to <<Setting-Up>>.

[[Setting-Up]]
== Setting Up
This section will describe the steps to successfully set up the project on your computer.

=== Prerequisites
Before setting up your project, you will need:

* *JDK `9`* or later.
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

* *IntelliJ* IDE.
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer
Here are the steps to set up the project in your computer:

. link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W16-2/main[Fork] this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors.
+
[NOTE]
Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully.
To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red.
Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error.
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way).

=== Verifying the setup
To verify that you have successfully set up your project on your computer, you must:

* Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
* <<Testing,Run the tests>> and ensure that they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code
Before you can start writing some code for your project, you must first set up the configurations for your project.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify this issue, you must:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

. Set `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'` to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
. Set the order of `Import Layout` to `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports` and add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

+
[NOTE]
Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, you should:

* Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
* Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design
This section will describe the design architecture and the various components of the system.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

This section describes the design architecture used by the system.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

.Architecture diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. +

=== Events-driven nature of the design

SocialCare uses an event-driven architecture style. +

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The figure below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how an event-driven approach helps us to reduce direct coupling between components.

=== Components

There are *6* main components: `Main`, `Commons`, `UI`, `Logic`, `Model`, and `Storage`. +
Given below is a brief overview of each component.

<<Design-Main,*`Main`*>> is the starting point of the system, which encapsulates the other components.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple components.

<<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>> contains the user interface classes used by the application.

<<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>> used to execute user commands. It is also known as the command executor.

<<Design-Model,*`Model`*>> holds the data of the application in-memory.

<<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>> which allows reading and writing of data to the hard disk.

For the `UI`, `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` components they:

* Define their _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Expose their functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the figure given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class diagram of the Logic component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Main]]
==== Main component

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.

[[Design-Commons]]
==== Commons component

`Commons` has classes used by multiple components. The classes are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by the different components to communicate with other components using events. (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by the classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

[[Design-Ui]]
==== UI component

The `UI` component contains classes which are responsible for displaying the user interface of the system. The figure below shows the structure of the `UI` component.

.Structure of the UI component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The `UI` component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherits from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component does the following:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can automatically update when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
==== Logic component

The `Logic` component contains classes which are needed to execute user commands. The figure below shows the structure of the `Logic` component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The flow for the `Logic` component is as follows:

. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
. The `Command` object (which is automatically created in the previous step) is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The executed `Command` affects the `Model` (e.g. adding a volunteer) and/or raise events.
. The result of the command execution from the previous step is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object.
. The `CommandResult` object is passed back to the `UI` component.

The figure below shows the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions inside the Logic component for the `delete 1` command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]


[[Design-Model]]
==== Model component

The `Model` component contains classes which are responsible for managing the data of the application. The figure below shows the structure of the `Model` component.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` component does the following:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* Stores the Address Book data.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Object>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.

Note that the `Model` component does not depend on any of the other components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `SocialCare`, which `Volunteer` can reference. This would allow `SocialCare` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Volunteer` needing their own `Tag` object. +
An example of how such a model may look like is given in the figure below. +

.Example of a more OOP Model
image::ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
==== Storage component

The `Storage` component contains classes which enables the reading/writing of data to the hard disk. The figure below shows the structure of the `Storage` component.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component does the following:

* saves `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* saves the system data in xml format and read it back.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
===== Current implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th volunteer in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new volunteer. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the volunteer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following figure shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence diagram of undo operation
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following figure summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

.Activity diagram of new command execution
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

===== Design considerations

====== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save the entire address book.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Implementation is easy.
|*Cons*| May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
|===
+
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.

+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
|*Cons*| Must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
|===
+


====== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
|*Cons*| Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
|===
+

* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
|*Cons*| Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
|===
+
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file. (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Designates critical error events which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Designates potentially harmful events which can be continued from, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Designates informational events that highlight noteworthy actions by the application.
* `FINE` : Designates event details that are not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).


//tag::command-add[]
=== Add Volunteer command
The `add` command in the volunteer context is used to add a volunteer to the application.

===== Current implementation

This `add` command requires the `AddCommandParser` class to parse user input and add a volunteer with the details specified by the user. Currently, the details that are required by the user is Name, VolunteerId (NRIC), Gender, Birthday, Phone, Email and Address.

`AddCommandParser` implements the `Parser` class which has the `Parser#parse()` operation. This operation will throw an error if the user input does not match the command format.

The `add` command updates the context in `ModelManager` through `addVolunteer`.

In addition to adding a volunteer, the `add` command also does the following:

* Saves the current database state through `commitAddressBook` (for undo/redo functions).
* Raise a `OverviewPanelVolunteerUpdateEvent` to update the Overview panel for volunteer context.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram for an `add` command in the volunteer context.

image::command_add_sd.png[switch SD, 800]

The following code snippet shows the fields that are required by the user when inputting the volunteer details for the `add` command:
```Java
public class AddCommand extends Command {
    //...
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);

        if (model.hasVolunteer(toAdd)) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_VOLUNTEER);
        }

        model.addVolunteer(toAdd);
        model.commitAddressBook();
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new OverviewPanelVolunteerUpdateEvent());
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, toAdd));
    }
    //...
}
```

===== Design considerations
====== Aspect: Choice of VolunteerId
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The use of unique identifier NRIC.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| It is unique to each volunteer, and validates the uniqueness of a volunteer entry.
|Cons| It is larger in size than an integer, hence may incur more storage use.
|===
+

* **Alternative 2:** Use of auto-incremented integer VolunteerId.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| It requires less storage, and easier to maintain.
|Cons| It may not be a strong indicator of uniqueness.
|===
+


====== Aspect: Birthday Display Format
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a BirthdayUtil class to change format of date.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| It requires less storage to store Birthday in original format.
|Cons| It requires BirthdayUtil to be invoked every time Birthday is to be displayed to the user.
|===
+

* **Alternative 2:** Immediately store Birthday as preferred user friendly format.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| It does not require BirthdayUtil to be invoked every time the Birthday is to be displayed to the user.
|Cons| It is difficult to maintain given that Birthday formats are of different length. Furthermore, requires more storage usage.
|===
+

//end::command-add[]

//tag::command-switch[]

[[Implementation-Switch]]
=== Switch command

The `switch` command is used to switch the context between 'volunteer' and 'event'.

===== Current implementation

This `switch` command requires the `SwitchCommandParser` class to parse user input and help determine the context to switch to. +

`SwitchCommandParser` implements the `Parser` class which has the `Parser#parse()` operation. This operation will throw an error if the user input does not match the command format or is an invalid context to switch to.

[NOTE]
There are only 2 valid contexts which a user can switch to with the command. +
v: 'volunteer' context +
e: 'event' context

The `switch` command updates the context found in `ModelManager` before raising the context change event to update the UI.

In addition to updating the context, the `switch` command also does the following:

* Clears all predicates for volunteers, events and record lists.
* Resets the state pointer (for undo/redo functions).
* Raises `ContextChangeEvent` to update the UI.

The following code snippet shows what the `switch` command does upon execution:
```Java
public class SwitchCommand extends Command {
    //...
    public SwitchCommand(String contextToSwitch) {
            requireNonNull(contextToSwitch);
            contextId = contextToSwitch;
    }

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) {
        requireNonNull(model);

        model.setCurrentContext(contextId);
        model.updateFilteredVolunteerList(Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_VOLUNTEERS);
        model.updateFilteredEventList(Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_EVENTS);
        model.updateFilteredRecordList(Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_RECORDS);
        model.resetStatePointer();

        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ContextChangeEvent(contextId));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, model.getContextName()));
    }
}
```

From the code snippet above, we see that upon calling the `SwitchCommand`, a contextId is set.
The contextId (which is retrieved from the user's input) is either 'e' for event or 'v' for volunteers.
This contextId will be used when the execute method is called.

When the execute method is called, the context is set in the model via the 'setCurrentContext' method.
The model contains different methods to update the various lists. A predicate is passed to reset each of the lists to the initial state.

The model also resets the state pointer so that the `undo` and `redo` functions will point to a fresh, new state.

Lastly, the `EventsCenter` posts a new event so that the panels would update accordingly and display the relevant lists.

The figure below is the sequence diagram to show how the `switch` command works when switching from volunteer to event context.

.Simplified sequence diagram of switch command
image::command_switch_sd.png[switch SD, 800]

===== Design considerations
====== Aspect: How context is maintained
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `Context` class.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Can support even more contexts in the future due to the flexibility of a class.
|Cons| Tedious to do as relevant methods have to be implemented in model.
|===
+

* **Alternative 2:** Pass a hard-coded context id around.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| No need to create a new object to handle the context.
|Cons| Difficult to maintain the id throughout the whole application. Any change in context id would require all the codes to be updated.
|===
+


// end::command-switch[]


// tag::exportcert[]
=== Export Volunteer Certificate

The `exportcert` command enables the volunteer manager to export a PDF document detailing a volunteer's involvement with the organisation.
This is only possible when in the 'volunteer' context. The information included in the certificate are as follows:

* Title: 'Certificate of Recognition'
* Date of export
* Volunteer name
* Volunteer ID
* List of events involved in - Event name, event ID, hours contributed, event start and event end dates
* Total hours contributed across all events

Currently, the certificate will be exported to either of these two locations:

* Folder named 'Certs' in the user's current working directory
* Direct to the user's current working directory (next to the .jar file)

This is what the exported PDF certificate will look like:

.Sample exported volunteer certificate

// tag::exportcert-sharan-ppp[]
===== Implementation

The following activity diagram shows us the control flow of the `exportcert` feature. Analysing this diagram would be a good way to understand the intended functionality of this feature.

.`exportcert` command activity diagram
[.thumb]
image::command_exportcert_ad.png[width="500"]

The following steps were involved in this feature's implementation:

1. Support for accepting `exportcert` command.
* Added an ExportCertCommand class that extends Command.
* Modified AddressBookParser class to accept an ExportCertCommand.

2. Support for accepting arguments as part of the command.
* Modified ExportCertCommand class to take in an Index.
* Added an ExportCertCommandParser class that parses the Index argument.
* Modified the AddressBookParser to use the ExportCertCommandParser.

3. Retrieve the right volunteer based on the given Index.
* Interact with the model to retrieve the filtered volunteer list.
* Get the Volunteer at the specified Index.

4. Retrieve information on the events that this volunteer has been involved in, if any.
* Interact with the model to get the filtered record list, and filter the record list further to find the records with the volunteer's ID.
* Retrieve the event IDs from the relevant filtered records, along with the hours contributed.
* Get the Event that corresponds to the event ID, and retrieve its name, startDate and endDate for input into the certificate.

5. Use of Apache PDFBox to create and export a volunteer certificate with the information retrieved.
* Involves the creation of a new https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.2/javadocs/index.html?org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/PDDocument.html[PDDocument],
with a https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.2/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/PDPage.html[PDPage] to write the content to.
* Writing of the information to a page content stream is then achieved using https://pdfbox.apache.org/docs/2.0.2/javadocs/org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/PDPageContentStream.html[PDPageContentStream].

The following sequence diagrams show how the `exportcert` operation will be executed for a valid command `exportcert 1`. Analyse these diagrams to achieve a more detailed understanding of the internal interactions involved in the execution of this feature.

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Medium of presentation

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Export as PDF
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Exports volunteer details in a convenient format for immediate use and distribution.
|*Cons*| PDF template has to be preset within the application.
|===
+

* *Alternative 2:* Display volunteer data in a window within the application
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Allows the volunteer manager flexibility as to what to do with the volunteer details. This could include manually inputting it into an existing certificate creation application, or a document template.
|*Cons*| Requires more manual work on the volunteer manager's side, especially when the process can be automated to enhance his/her productivity. Certificate templates are also infrequently updated, and thus the costs in terms of efficiency outweigh the benefits in terms of flexibility.
|===
+


====== Aspect: Choice of PDF creation tool

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Apache PDFBox
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Open source, offers more specific functionality for PDFs than Apache FOP, and covers all of the pdf creation and manipulation functionality required for this feature.
|*Cons*| Not the most efficient for creating PDFs (refer to http://abhishekkumararya.blogspot.com/2013/09/comparison-of-java-based-pdf-generation.html[this comparison study]).
|===
+

* *Alternative 2:* Apache FOP
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Open source, allows for conversion and formatting of XML data to PDF.
|*Cons*| Resource intensive, not the most efficient for PDF creation, and lacks features such as updating and merging PDFs.
|===
+

* *Alternative 3:* iText
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Fastest of the lot for PDF generation (refer to http://abhishekkumararya.blogspot.com/2013/09/comparison-of-java-based-pdf-generation.html[this comparison study]).
|*Cons*| Now only available as a free trial, and requires a license for extended use.
|===
+


====== Aspect: Choice of export location

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Export to the user's current working directory
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Putting the files relative to where the app is allows the user to locate, manage and access the exports easily as this is a portable app. The app jar and the exported files can be shifted to different locations together easily as well.
|*Cons*| Navigating to this directory would be necessary if he/she wishes to access the files independent of using the application.
|===
+

* **Alternative 2:** Export to the user's Desktop
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Easy to access files when not using the application.
|*Cons*| As it is a portable app, it may be cumbersome to keep navigating to the Desktop to access the exports when using the application. It also becomes harder to move the app jar and exports together from place to place.
|===
+

* **Alternative 3:** Allow the user to specify the export filepath as an argument
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Allows for greater customisability, thus catering to each user's unique needs.
|*Cons*| Requires user to have accurate prior knowledge of the machine's filepath format. Moreover, support for all possible OS filepath formats within the application may not be possible as well (e.g. custom OS filepath).
|===
+


====== Aspect: Organisation of PDF generation code

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Encapsulate within a `CertGenerator` class with exposed public method(s)
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Allows for separation of concerns as handling command result or exceptions & retrieving volunteer data is separated from the creation, population and export of the certificate. Also allows for future extension of the PDF generation feature (e.g. generating event reports) through adding a `ExportPdf` abstract class or interface with `generatePdf`, `populatePdf` and `exportPdf` methods to be implemented.
|*Cons*| Introduces inherent coupling between `ExportCertCommand` and `CertGenerator` classes as currently, only `ExportCertCommand` includes the certificate generation functionality.
|===
+

* **Alternative 2:** Leave PDF generation code inside a method within the `ExportCertCommand` class
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Allows the certificate generation code to reside exactly where it is used, as the certificate generation functionality is currently only used by `ExportCertCommand`.
|*Cons*| Causes a low level of cohesion by packaging different functionalities within `ExportCertCommand`. The functionality to export PDFs also remains unabstracted, and thus extending the functionality to create e.g. event report PDFs would require repetition of the PDF generation code.
|===
+
// end::exportcert-sharan-ppp[]

====== Aspect: Choice of additional details for identifying volunteer from certificate

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use Volunteer's NRIC
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Adds credibility to the certificate by displaying something that is unique to each volunteer, and can be recovered easily given the volunteer's name or other personal information.
|*Cons*| Requires more space as each NRIC has to be represented as string of length 9 or a 7-digit integer.
|===
+

* **Alternative 2:** Use a Volunteer ID
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Achieves the intended purpose (additional volunteer identification), while encompassing the ability to be auto-incremented.
|*Cons*| Hard to recover, even if additional information about the volunteer is provided. It would also be meaningless to a third person to whom the certificate is presented for verification purposes.
|===
+

// end::exportcert[]

// tag::eventmanagement[]
=== Auto-incremented event ID

The auto-incremented event ID field is used by the `Record` class to identify unique events. An integer ID field is used because
the alternative method of identifying unique events based on multiple `Event` attribute fields would be computationally inefficient.

===== Current implementation

The auto-incremented event ID field is facilitated by the `Event` class. The `Event` class
keeps track of the highest ID in the system. Additionally, it implements two different constructors for different situations:

* `Event(Name name, Location location, Date startDate, Date endDate,
                    Time startTime, Time endTime, Description description, Set<Tag> tags)`
+
This constructor is used when working with an event that does not yet exist in the system (e.g. adding a new event).
+
It increments the current highest event ID in the system and assigns that value to the new event that is created. This behaviour is illustrated in the code snippet of the `Event` class below.
+
``` Java
public Event(Name name, Location location, Date startDate, Date endDate, Time startTime, Time endTime, Description description, Set<Tag> tags) {
        ...
        incrementMaxId();
        this.eventId = new EventId(maxId);
        ...
}

private void incrementMaxId() {
    maxId += 1;
}
```

* `Event(EventId eventId, Name name, Location location, Date startDate, Date endDate,
                    Time startTime, Time endTime, Description description, Set<Tag> tags)`
+
This constructor is used when working with an event that already exists in the system (e.g. loading data from XML file or editing an existing event).
+
It checks whether the ID of the event being initialised is greater than the current highest ID in the system.
If this condition is true, the current highest event ID value will be replaced by the ID of the event being initialised.
This behaviour is illustrated in the code snippet of the `Event` class below.
+
``` Java
public Event(Name name, Location location, Date startDate, Date endDate, Time startTime, Time endTime, Description description, Set<Tag> tags) {
        ...
        if (isEventIdGreaterThanMaxId(eventId.id)) {
            replaceMaxIdWithEventId(eventId.id);
        }
        ...
}

private void replaceMaxIdWithEventId(int eventId) {
    maxId = eventId;
}
```

===== Design considerations
====== Aspect: How event ID is generated
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Increment from highest event ID
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Implementation is easy.
|*Cons*| Maintained highest event ID may be susceptible to overwrite and become desynchronised.
|===
+
* *Alternative 2:* Randomly generated unique event ID
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|*Pros*| Not dependent on a maintained highest event ID variable (single point of failure).
|*Cons*| Requires keeping track of all existing event IDs to ensure uniqueness.
|===
+

// end::eventmanagement[]

//tag::command-manage[]
[[Implementation-Manage]]
=== Manage command

The `manage` command is used in the 'event' context to manage the volunteering records for an event. +

===== Current implementation
This `manage` command requires the `ManageCommandParser` class to parse user input and determine which event to manage. +

`ManageCommandParser` implements the `Parser` class which has the `Parser#parse()` operation. This operation will throw an error if the user input is an invalid event id.

The `manage` command updates the context found in `ModelManager` through the `model#switchToRecordContext()` function. +

In addition to updating the context, the `manage` command also does the following:

* Clears all predicates for volunteer list.
* Filters the existing records by the selected event.
* Resets the state pointer (for undo/redo functions).
* Raises `RecordChangeEvent` to set the selected event.
* Raises `ContextChangeEvent` to update the UI.

The following code snippet shows what the `manage` command does upon execution:

```Java
public class ManageCommand extends Command {
    //...
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);

        List<Event> filteredEventList = model.getFilteredEventList();
        model.updateFilteredVolunteerList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_VOLUNTEERS);

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= filteredEventList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_EVENT_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        model.switchToRecordContext();
        model.setSelectedEvent(filteredEventList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased()));
        model.updateFilteredRecordList(new RecordContainsEventIdPredicate(
                filteredEventList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased()).getEventId()
        ));
        model.resetStatePointer();


        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new RecordChangeEvent(
                filteredEventList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased())));
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ContextChangeEvent(model.getContextId()));

        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_MANAGE_EVENT_SUCCESS,
                filteredEventList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased()).getName().fullName)
                + " [" + targetIndex.getOneBased() + "]");

    }
    //...
}
```

From the code snippet above, we see that the current state of event list from the model is stored into another list called 'filteredEventList'.
Storing the events in another list is done so that the list can be easily referenced in later parts of the code.

The volunteer list in the model is updated with the predicate so that it now contains the list of all volunteers in the system.

A quick check is done to ensure that the user input is valid. Otherwise, an exception is thrown.

If the user input is valid, the application changes to the record context. Then, the selected event by the user is stored in the model.
In addition, the model resets the state pointer so that the `undo` and `redo` functions will point to a fresh, new state.

Lastly, all the relevant UI is updated by posting events via the `EventsCenter`.

The figure below is the sequence diagram to show how the `switch` command works when switching from volunteer to event context.

.Simplified sequence diagram for manage command
image::command_manage_sd.png[manage SD, 800]

===== Design considerations
====== Aspect: Context switching (to volunteering records)
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilize `Context` class used in the `switch` function. (See <<Implementation-Switch>>)
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| No need to create a new class to change context.
|Cons| Have to create a new method in `Context` class to handle parsed user input.
|===
+

* **Alternative 2:** Pass event and volunteer objects via `LogicManager`.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Implementation is easy.
|Cons| Classes becomes tightly coupled. The UI component would have access to methods it does not need.
|===
+

//end::command-manage[]


//tag::command-overview[]
[[Implementation-Overview]]
=== Overview command
The `overview` command is used in the 'event' or 'volunteer' context to show statistics for the number of types of events and volunteer distribution.

===== Current implementation
The `overview` command raises a `OverviewPanelChangedEvent` to start calculating statistical data and to
update the UI.

Because of the volatile nature of the data (it can change when attributes of events or volunteers are changed), the data is not stored persistently in the `ModelManager`.

Instead, whenever the `OverviewPanel` UI class detects an `OverviewPanelChangedEvent`, it calls on the `Overview` to provide it with updated statistics.

The figure below is the sequence diagram to show how the `overview` command works when running from the 'event' context.
Note that the `OverviewPanel` calls the calculateNumOfEvents and calculateVolunteerDemographics methods in `Overview` class.

.Simplified sequence diagram for `overview` command
image::command_overview_sd.png[overview SD, 800]

In the calculateNumOfEvents method, events are categorised into 3 events types:

* Upcoming (events that have yet to happen).
* Ongoing (events that are currently happening).
* Completed (events that have already happened).

The categorisation process can be found in the `DateTimeUtil` class in the getEventStatus method.
The start to end period of each event is compared with the current date and time to determine its category.
This behaviour is illustrated in the code snippet below.

``` Java
public static int getEventStatus(Date startDate, Time startTime, Date endDate, Time endTime) {
    ...
    if (now.compareTo(start) < 0) {
        return UPCOMING_EVENT;
    } else if (now.compareTo(start) >= 0 && now.compareTo(end) <= 0) {
        return ONGOING_EVENT;
    } else {
        return COMPLETED_EVENT;
    }
    ...
}
```

In the calculateVolunteerDemographics method, the ages of volunteers are derived from their birthdates instead of being stored in the system.

===== Design considerations

====== Aspect: How statistics are aggregated
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calculate statistics from scratch using existing volunteers and events
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| No need to store and maintain volatile statistical data.
|Cons| Requires heavier processing every time statistics are aggregated.
|===
+

* **Alternative 2:** Store and maintain statistics after each operation
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| No need for heavy computation as a result of building statistics from scratch.
|Cons| Have to propagate changes to statistical data after changes to volunteers and events.
|===
+

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide documentation settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file documentation settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

|===

=== Site template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

Testing is done to verify how the application runs, responds and process commands given by the Admin, to check if the app runs with its intended behavior.

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release:

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than the following alternatives: +
1) Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
2) Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/volunteer/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a volunteer, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/volunteer/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each volunteer, and remove the `tag` from each volunteer.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last volunteer in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside volunteer cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a volunteer specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first volunteer to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first volunteer.

==== Step-by-step instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each volunteer later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/volunteer/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/volunteer/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/volunteer/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/volunteer/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the volunteer will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/volunteer/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the volunteer that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a volunteer.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

== Non Functional Requirements

*  Reasonable response time (2-3s)
*  Backward compatibility by being able to transfer data from older versions of the application when updating each version
*  Should work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java `9` or higher installed.
*  Files containing volunteer data should be encrypted
*  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.
