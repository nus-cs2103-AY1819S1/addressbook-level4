== Introduction

Expense Tracker is a desktop application that you can use to track your expenses. Expense Tracker provides you
with features such as setting a budget and expense statistics, which help you stay within your budget.

The *Expense Tracker Developer Guide* contains all the information you need to start development on Expense Tracker. It
also includes information about the overall architecture and implementation of various features in Expense Tracker.
Whether this is your first project or your 37th project, this guide will help you to start contribute to Expense Tracker.
Jump to <<Setting up, Setting up>> to start setting up your environment.

== Set Up

'''
Follow the steps in the section below to start development on Expense Tracker

'''

=== Prerequisites

You will need to ensure that you have these two programs installed on your computer:

. *https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html[Java Development Kit (JDK) `9`]*

+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Therefore we highly recommended you to use JDK `9`.

. An Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We recommend using https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[*IntelliJ*] as
instructions related to the IDE in this guide assume the use of IntelliJ
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed by default, which are both used in the development of Expense Tracker.
If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them. +


=== The Project
Follow these steps to set up the project:

. Fork this repo and clone the fork to your computer, in a folder of your choice.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the https://i.stack.imgur.com/cQnLl.png[welcome screen], click `File` > `Close
Project` to close the existing project dialog first).

. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file in the project folder and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

In order to verify that you have successfully set the project up:

. Run `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> and ensure that they all pass.

=== Configurations

The following lists configurations that should be applied before writing code:

==== Coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding
standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify:

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the instructions in the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Documentation

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (instead of contributing to Expense Tracker), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

[NOTE]
See <<Implementation-Configuration>> for more configurations to set if you wish to develop this fork as a separate product

[TIP]
In the Developer Guide, many diagrams are used to illustrate various components of Expense tracker. These are created using `.pptx`
files used which can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram
in the relevant pptx file, select the all objects of the diagram, right click and choose `Save as picture`. You can then
save the image in the link:{repoURL}/docs/images/[images] folder, and use them in the Developer Guide.

==== Continuous Integration

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team's fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#,
UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)


'''
Now you're all set to start coding! If you want to get a sense of the overall design, take some time to read up on the
<<Design-Architecture, design>> of the application.

'''

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Overview of Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of Expense Tracker. Given below is a
quick overview for each component

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* Initialising the components in the correct sequence and connecting them up with each other when the app is launched.
* Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary when the app is shut down.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events.
See <<Event-driven, Event-Driven Design>> from more details.
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many components to write log messages to Expense Tracker's log file.

`Logic` is the command executor. It defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.
Read <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>> for more details.

`UI` is responsible for the UI of the App. It defines its API in the `Ui.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `UiManager.java` class.
Read <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>> for more details.

`Model` holds the data of the App in-memory. It defines its API in the `Model.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `ModelManager.java` class.
Read <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>> for more details.

`Storage` reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.It defines its API in the `Storage.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `StorageManager.java` class.
Read <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>> for more details.

[discrete]
[[Event-driven]]
==== Events-Driven Design

Expense Tracker's architecture style is an events-driven style. To illustrate how the architecture works, we will use
the scenario of a user issuing the command 'delete 1'.
The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows the first part of component interaction once the command is given.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how `Model` simply raises an `ExpenseTrackerChangedEvent` when there is a change in the data, instead of asking `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through `EventsCenter` to `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

As per the diagram above, `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExpenseListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

`UI` uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

Below lists other functions that `UI` carries out:

* Executes user commands using `Logic`.
* Binds itself to some data in `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

As per the diagram above, `Logic` uses `ExpenseTrackerParser` to parse user commands.
This results in a `Command` object which is executed by `LogicManager`. +

The execution of certain commands can affect `Model`, like adding a expense, and/or raise events, like the `stats` command.
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to `UI`.

Given below is the _Sequence Diagram_ for interactions within `Logic` for `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::UpdatedModelComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

As per the diagram above, `ModelManager` implements the `Model` interface, which:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a list of expenses.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Expense>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
To better adhere to the paradigms of OOP, we could store a `Tag` list in `Expense Tracker`, which `Expense` can
reference. This allows `Expense Tracker` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`,
instead of each `Expense` needing their own `Tag` object. This is planned to be implemented in future releases.
An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterOopModelComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

As per the diagram above, `StorageManager` implements the `Storage` interface, which:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save Expense Tracker data in xml format and read it back.
* can read multiple xml format files with separate Expense Tracker data from a folder.
* stores XmlAdaptedPassword as a SHA-256 hash of the original password.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedExpenseTracker`.
It extends `ExpenseTracker` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `expenseTrackerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedExpenseTracker#commit()` -- Saves the current Expense Tracker state in its history.
* `VersionedExpenseTracker#undo()` -- Restores the previous Expense Tracker state from its history.
* `VersionedExpenseTracker#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone Expense Tracker state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitExpenseTracker()`, `Model#undoExpenseTracker()` and `Model#redoExpenseTracker()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. `VersionedExpenseTracker` will be initialized with the initial Expense Tracker state, and `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single Expense Tracker state.

.Step 1 of undo/redo mechanism
image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th expense in Expense Tracker. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitExpenseTracker()`, causing the modified state of Expense Tracker after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in `expenseTrackerStateList`, and `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Expense Tracker state.

.Step 2 of undo/redo mechanism
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new expense. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitExpenseTracker()`, causing another modified Expense Tracker state to be saved into `expenseTrackerStateList`.

.Step 3 of undo/redo mechanism
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitExpenseTracker()`, so Expense Tracker state will not be saved into `expenseTrackerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the expense was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoExpenseTracker()`, which will shift `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Expense Tracker state, and restores Expense Tracker to that state.

.Step 4 of undo/redo mechanism
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Expense Tracker state, then there are no previous Expense Tracker states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoExpenseTracker()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence Diagram for undo operation
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoExpenseTracker()`, which shifts `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores Expense Tracker to that state.

[NOTE]
If `currentStatePointer` is at index `expenseTrackerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Expense Tracker state, then there are no undone Expense Tracker states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoExpenseTracker()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify Expense Tracker, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitExpenseTracker()`, `Model#undoExpenseTracker()` or `Model#redoExpenseTracker()`. Thus, `expenseTrackerStateList` remains unchanged.

.Step 5 of undo/redo mechanism
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitExpenseTracker()`. Since `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of `expenseTrackerStateList`, all Expense Tracker states after `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

.Step 6 of undo/redo mechanism
image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Expense Tracker.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the expense being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of Expense Tracker states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedExpenseTracker`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

//tag::useraccounts[]

=== User Accounts System
The user accounts system allows multiple users to use Expense Tracker on the same computer without interfering with each other's data. It also includes an optional password system that allows users to protect their Expense Tracker information from being viewed or altered by others.

==== Current Implementation
On initialization, `MainApp` class loads all xml files within the data folder according to the path in `UserPrefs`. The data is loaded by `MainApp#initModelManager(Storage, UserPref)`.
[NOTE]
====
An xml data file not be loaded if the username value is not the same as the filename (ignoring file extension).
====

This system is facilitated by newly added methods in the Model interface which now supports the following operations:

* `Model#loadUserData(Username, Password)` -- Logs in to the user with the input Username and Password and loads the associated data into `Model`. Returns true if the password matches the user's password, else the user is not logged into and false is returned
* `Model#unloadUserData()` -- Unselects the user in `Model`
* `Model#isUserExists(Username)` -- Checks if a user with the input Username exists in `Model`
* `Model#addUser(Username)` -- Adds a new user with the given Username to `Model`
* `Model#hasSelectedUser()` -- Checks if a user is currently logged in in `Model`

The classes `Username` and `Password` have also been implemented and have the following noteworthy characteristics:

* Two `Username` classes are equivalent if and only if the internal username String are equivalent (case-insensitive).
* `Username` cannot be constructed with a String containing any of the following characters: _" > < : \ / | ? *_
* When a `Password` class is constructed with plain text, the password is hashed before being stored as an internal String in the `Password` object
* `Password` is only valid if the plain text form is at least 6 characters long

Below is an example usage scenario and how the User Account System behaves at each step when the application is launched.

. The user launches the application and the directory path in the UserPref points at the _data_ folder
. The method `StorageManager#readAllExpenses(Path)` is called by the MainApp and the method loads all the xml data files in the _data_ folder and returns the loaded data as a `Map<Username, EncryptedExpensetracker>` with the `Username` of the user data as the key and the user data as an `EncryptedExpenseTracker` as the value to the MainApp class.
. A `Model` instance will then be initialized using the previously mentioned `Map` of user data.

Below is the UML sequence diagram of the `StorageManager#readAllExpenses(Path)` method mentioned.

.Sequence diagram of the `StorageManager#readAllExpenses(Path)` method
image::implementation/ReadAllExpensesSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Below is an example usage scenario and how the Sign Up and Login system behaves at each step after the application is launched.

. The user executes the command `signup john` to create a user with the `Username` john
. The `signup` command calls `Model#addUser(Username)` which adds the user `john` to `Model`. The operation is successful as `john` does not break any of the `Username` constraints and does not already exist in the Model.
. The user then executes the command `login u/john` to log in to his user account
. The `login` command calls `loadUserData(Username, Password)` with a null password as a password was not provided. The method is executed successfully as the user `john` has no password set.
. The selected data in `Model` is switched to `john`'s and an `UserLoggedInEvent` is raised for `UI` to show `john`'s Expense Tracker data

Below is the UML sequence diagram that shows how `SignUpCommand` works.

.Sequence diagram showing how `SignUpCommand` works
image::implementation/SignUpCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Below is the UML sequence diagram that shows how `LoginCommand` works.

.Sequence diagram showing how `LoginCommand` works
image::implementation/LoginCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Below is an example usage scenario and how the Password system behaves at each step after the he/she is logged in.

. The user is already logged in to the account `john` with an existing password `password1` and executes the command `setpassword o/password1 n/password2` to change his password to `password2`
. The `setpassword` command calls the `Model#setPassword(Password)` method since the given old password matches his existing password and `password2` does not violate any password constraints
. The `Model#setPassword(Password)` changes `john`'s account password to `password2`

Below is the UML sequence diagram that shows how `SetPasswordCommand` works.

.Sequence diagram showing how `SetPasswordCommand` works
image::implementation/SetPasswordCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Storage of Separate User Data

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save each user's data into a seperate xml file
** Pros: More work needed to implement as the data loading has to be changed to read from multiple xml files
** Cons: Users can transfer their own data between computers easily by just copying their own account's xml file
* **Alternative 2:** Save all the separated user data in a single xml data file
** Pros: Relatively easier to implement. ExpenseTracker already loads data from a single xml data file so less work has to be done to change the storage structure
** Cons: Users will be unable to easily transfer their individual data to another computer

===== Aspect: Loading of User Data

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Loading of User data is only done on initialization of Expense Tracker
** Pros: Ability to switch user accounts quickly after Expense Tracker is loaded as all users are already loaded into memory
** Cons: External changes to the data files after initialization will not be reflected may be overwritten
* **Alternative 2:** User data is loaded only when the user attempts to log in
** Pros: Unnecessary data is not kept in memory so memory space is not wasted
** Cons: Increase degree of coupling between the Logic, Model and Storage components as the login command will require the Storage to load and return the user's data.
// end::useraccounts[]

// tag::statistics[]
=== Statistics

The implementation of the Statistics function can be divided into two parts - preparation and execution.
Given below is an example usage scenario and an explanation of how the statistics mechanism behaves at each step.

==== Preparation
In the preparation phase, the program parses the command for statistics, prepares filters used by the model
and posts events in `EventsCenter`.
Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation of the preparation stage.

.Sequence diagram of the preparation stage in the statistics mechanism
image::implementation/StatsCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. User enters command `stats n/7 p/d m/t`. The command is received by `ExpenseTrackerParser`, which calls `StatsCommandParser#parse()`
to create a `StatsCommand` object with the two extracted parameters. The `StatsCommand` object is returned to `LogicManager`.

. `LogicManager` then calls `StatsCommand#execute()`, which updates `Predicate` and `StatsMode` in `ModelManager and
also posts a `ShowStatsRequestEvent` and `SwapLeftPanelEvent` event to `EventsCenter`.

In this example, `Predicate` is set to filter out expenses which have dates within the last 7 days and
`StatsPeriod` is set to TIME, which will be used later to have the UI display a bar chart instead of a pie chart.

==== Execution
In the execution phase, the program handles the events posted by `StatsCommand` by
processing and retrieving the data to be displayed and finally displaying it.
Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation of the execution stage.

.Sequence diagram of the execution stage in the statistics mechanism
image::implementation/StatsUiSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. The `ShowStatsRequestEvent` event is handled by `MainWindow#handleShowStatsEvent()`, which calls 'StatisticsPanel#setData()'
and passes the data as parameters by calling
`Logic#getExpenseStats()`, `Logic#getStatsPeriod()`, `Logic#getStatsMode()` and `Logic#getPeriodAmount()`.

. `Logic#getExpenseStats()` gets the filtered expense list by calling `Model#getExpenseStats()`, which returns
an unmodifiable `ObservableList`, only containing only expenses in the last 7 days, as per `Predicate`, and sorted by date.
`Logic#getExpenseStats()` then organises the data into a `LinkedHashMap<String, Double>`, where the key value pair represents
the x and y values of the chart. In this case, `StatsMode` is set to TIME, which results in a x,y values of date and cost.
If `StatsMode` is set to CATEGORY, the x,y values will be set to category and cost.

. `Logic#getStatsPeriod()`, `Logic#getStatsMode()` and `Logic#getPeriodAmount()` gets their respective data
 by calling the method of the same name in `Model`.

. Once the parameters are passed into `StatisticsPanel#setData()`, `StackPane#getChildren()#clear()` is called to clear
any display elements in `StackPane`.

. In this case, `StatsMode` is set to TIME, which results in `StatisticsPanel#setTimeBasedData()` to be called, which
generates a Bar Chart and calls `StackPane#getChildren()#add()`, which adds it to `StackPane`.
If `StatsMode` is set to CATEGORY, which results in `StatisticsPanel#setCategoryBasedData()` to be called, which
generates a Pie Chart and calls `StackPane#getChildren()#add()`, which adds it to `StackPane`.
If the data received is empty, a `Text` object is generated and `StackPane#getChildren()#add()` is called,
which informs the user that there are no expenditures

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to handle statistics data and parameters

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Data and each parameter is handled as separate objects
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Need to call multiple methods to get parameters
* **Alternative 2 (planned for future releases):** Create Statistics object which contains data and all the parameters.
** Pros: More scalable. Less method calls to get parameters.
** Cons: None

===== Aspect: How to pass statistics data and parameters from Command to UI

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** UI gets all data and parameters from `Logic`, which gets data from `Model`.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Aligned with architecture.
** Cons: A lot of method calls
* **Alternative 2:** Pass data and parameters through event
** Pros: Less method calls. Easier to read.
** Cons: Not in alignment with architecture. Need to consider application startup when there are no events posted.

// tag::find[]
=== Find

Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation of an example usage scenario.

.Sequence diagram of find mechanism
image::implementation/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. User enters command `find n/Have Lunch f/Food d/01-01-2018:03-01-2018`. The command is received by `ExpenseTrackerParser`,
which then creates a `FindCommandParser` Object and calls `FindCommandParser#parse()` method.

. `FindCommandParser#parse()` method calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to tokenize the input String into keywords and store them in
an `ArgumentMultimap` Object.

. `FindCommandParser#parse()` method then calls `ParserUtil#ensureKeywordsAreValid()` method. If any
of the keywords doesn't conform to the correct format, `ParseException` will be thrown. If no exception is thrown, a
`ExpenseContainsKeywordsPredicate` Object is created. It implements Predicate<Expense> interface and is used to filter
out all the expenses which matches the keywords entered by the user.

. A `FindCommand` Object with the `ExpenseContainsKeywordsPredicate` Object as parameter is created and returned to
`LogicManager`.

. `LogicManager` then calls `FindCommand#execute()`,which calls `Model#updateFilteredExpenseList()`
method to update the predicate of FilterList<Expense>. FilterList now contains new set of expenses which filtered by the
new predicate.

. Then the expense list panel will show a new set of expenses according to the keywords. A `CommandResult` is then created
and returned to `LogicManager`.

// end::find[]

// tag::massedit[]
=== Mass Edit

Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation of an example usage scenario.

.Sequence diagram of mass edit mechanism
image::implementation/MassEditCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. User enters command `massedit c/school -> c/work d/01-01-2018`. The command is received by `ExpenseTrackerParser`,
  which then creates a `MassEditCommandParser` Object and calls `MassEditCommandParser#parse()` method.

. `MassEditCommandParser#parse()` method calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to tokenize the input String into keywords and store them in
two `ArgumentMultimap` Objects.

. `MassEditCommandParser#parse()` method then create a `ExpenseContainsKeywordsPredicate` Object. Then it calls `EditExpenseDescriptor#createEditExpenseDescriptor()` method to create an
`EditExpenseDescriptor` Object which stores the fields of expenses which are going to be edited.

. A `MassEditCommand` Object with the `ExpenseContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `EditExpenseDescriptor` Object as parameters is created and returned to
`LogicManager`.

. `LogicManager` then calls `MassEditCommand#execute()`,which calls `Model#updateFilteredExpenseList()`
method to update the predicate of FilterList<Expense>. `Model#getFilteredExpenseList()` is called to return the FilterList<Expense>.

. A loop starts and for each `Expense` in the FilterList<Expense>, `EditExpenseDescriptor#createEditedExpense()` is called to create an edited Expense object.
Then `Model#updateExpense` is called to replace the original `Expense` with edited `Expense`.

. When loop ends, `Model#updateFilteredExpenseList()` is called again to show the edit `Expense` to the user.
A `CommandResult` is then created and returned to `LogicManager`.

// tag::UserInterfaceRedesign[]
=== User Interface Redesign

The UI has been redesigned to implement the following UI elements required for Expense Tracker:

* Budget Panel
* Statistics Panel
* Notifications Panel
* Categories Panel

Animations will also be incorporated into the UI elements for a better user experience.

==== Budget Panel

The `totalBudget` panel consists of 3 UI elements:

*	`BudgetPanel#expenseDisplay` – A `Text` element that displays the user’s current expenses.
*	`BudgetPanel#budgetDisplay` – A `Text` element that displays the user’s monthly budget cap.
*	`BudgetPanel#budgetBar` – A `progressBar` element that visually presents the percentage of the current
`totalBudget` cap that has been used.

Given below is an example scenario of how `BudgetPanel` is updated:

. The user launches the application and signs up for a new account. The `MainWindow` creates a new `BudgetPanel`, which elements are initialized as follows:
* `BudgetPanel#expenseDisplay` is green and set to "$0.00".
* `BudgetPanel#budgetDisplay` is set to "/ $28.00", with $28.00 being the default `totalBudget`.
* `BudgetPanel#budgetBar` is green and at 0% progress.

. The user executes the command `add n/Lunch $/30.00 c/Food`. As the `'add` command modifies `totalBudget` and
expenses, `AddCommand#execute()` will post a `UpdateBudgetPanelEvent` event to the EventsCenter.
[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, `UpdateBudgetPanelEvent` will not be posted.

. The `UpdateBudgetPanelEvent` event is handled by `BudgetPanel#handleBudgetPanelEvent()`, which calls `BudgetPanel#update()`.

. `BudgetPanel#update()` calls `BudgetPanel#animateBudgetPanel()`, which creates a new `Timeline` object.

. Two `KeyFrame` objects are added to the Timeline that smooths the transition of the `BudgetPanel#budgetBar` progress percentage from 0% to the updated percentage.
[NOTE]
If the updated percentage is more than 1.0, `BudgetPanel#budgetBar` progress percentage will be set to 1.0. Barring oversights, the progress percentage should never fall below 0.0.

. A call to 'BudgetPanel#incrementKeyFrames()` is made to create the incrementing animation for `BudgetPanel#expenseDisplay`. The total time for this animation is 0.5 seconds, and consists of 10 `KeyFrame` objects. With this information, the amount to increment `BudgetPanel#expenseDisplay` by each `KeyFrame` can be calculated.
 `BudgetPanel#updateExpenseDisplay()` is called to increment `BudgetPanel#expenseDisplay`.
[NOTE]
`BudgetPanel#incrementKeyFrames()` handles the animation for both `BudgetPanel#budgetDisplay` and `BudgetPanel#expenseDisplay` at the same time.

. `Timeline#playFromStart()` is called to execute the animation.

. `BudgetPanel#update()` also calls `BudgetPanel#setBudgetUiColors()`. The method detects that the user has gone
over budget, and changes the color of `BudgetPanel#expenseDisplay` and `BudgetPanel#budgetBar` from green to red.
[NOTE]
Similarly, if the user has gone from over budget to under budget, the color of
'BudgetPanel#expenseDisplay` and `BudgetPanel#budgetBar` should change from red to green.

The following sequence diagram shows the process of updating the `BudgetPanel` UI elements:

.Sequence diagram of the `BudgetPanel` update
image::implementation/BudgetPanelSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: Which library to implement animation

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `Timeline` and `KeyFrame` classes
** Pros: More flexible; Able to create the animation frame by frame.
** Cons: Animations tricks and effects will require manual tweaking for the intented effect.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `Transition` class
** Pros: The class is specialized, and thus has built-in methods to create better animations For example, `EASE-BOTH` can be used to cause the transition to accelerate at different points for a better effect)
** Cons: Does not work for certain desired effects, such as the 'incrementing' effect required for `Text` elements of `BudgetPanel`.

==== Notification System
The Notification System is comprised of 3 features:
* `Notification` - An abstract method that consists of a `header`, `type` and `body`. There are two types of `Notification`,
`TipNotification` and `WarningNotification`.
* `NotificationPanel` `and NotificationCard` - Lists the notifications that have been sent to the user.
* `NotificationHandler` - Handles the storing and logic of notifications.
* `NotificationCommand` - Allows the user to toggle what type of notifications they wish to receive.

Given below is an example scenario of how the Notification System functions:

. The user launches the application for the first time. A new `NotificationHandler` is instantiated.

. A call to `NotificationHandler#isTimeToSendTip` is made upon login. In turn, a check is made to see if it has
been a day since the last `TipNotification` has been sent. If so, a new `TipNotification` is added to `NotificationHandler#internalList` via a call to `NotificationPanel#addNotification`.
[NOTE]
If this is the user's first time logging into their account, a new `TipNotification` will be sent.

. The user executes the command `add n/Lunch $/30.00 c/Food`. The `add` command calls `NotificationHandler#isTimeToSendWarning` to check if the user is nearing or over their budget.
If the user is nearing or approaching their budget, a `WarningNotification` is added to `NotificationHandler#internalList` via a call to `NotificationPanel#addNotification`.
[NOTE]
The same procedure is carried out if the user execute an `edit` command.

. If the size of `NotificationHandler#internalList` reaches 11 or more, the oldest `Notification` in the list is then replaced with
the new `Notification`.

Given below is an example scenario of how `NotificationCommand` functions:
. The user executes `notification n/warning t/off`. THe command is received by `ExpenseTrackerParser`.

.  A call to `NotificationCommand#parse` is made, which creates a `NotificationCommandDescriptor` object with the two
extracted parameters `warning` and `off`. A `NotificationCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`.
[NOTE]
The `n/` parameter can be omitted. In this case, all types of notifications will be affected by the toggle.

. `LogicManager` then calls `NotificationCommand#execute`, which calls `NotificationHandler#toggleWarningNotifications` to set
`NotificationPanel#isWarningEnabled` to `false`.
[NOTE]
 If `notification n/tip t/on` was executed, `NotificationHandler#toggleTipNotifications` would be called to set `NotificationHandler#isTipEnabled`
 to `true`.
 If`notification t/on` was executed, `NotificationHandler#toggleBothNotifications` will be called instead.


// end::userInterfaceRedesign[]

// tag::budget[]

=== Budget
==== Current Implementation
The budget feature allows the user to set a budget for their expenses.
If the user's total expenses exceeds their budget, a warning will be shown to the user.

The current implementation for budget tracking is described as below.

===== Setting a Budget

Given below is a sequence diagram and step by step explanation of how Expense Tracker executes when a user sets a budget

.Sequence diagram of a user setting a budget.
image::implementation/BudgetCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. User enters command `setBudget 2.00`.
. The command is received by `ExpenseTrackerParser`, which then creates a `SetBudgetCommandParser` Object and calls
`SetBudgetCommandParser#parse()` method.
. `SetBudgetCommandParser#parse()` will then return a `budget` of `double` type. It will then create a
`SetBudgetCommand` Object with `budget` as a parameter would be created and returned to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` then calls `SetBudgetCommand#execute()`, which calls `ModelManager#modifyMaximumBudget` to update the
 maximum budget of Expense Tracker.
. `LogicManager` will then call `EventsCenter#post()` to update the UI, displaying the updated budget.
. The budget is then updated.


===== Setting a recurring Budget

Every time a user logs in, `Model#loadUserData()` is called and  the application will check if the user has set a time
where the
current expenses will reset (recurrence time). If it is not set, Expense Tracker will issue a notification. Else,
Expense Tracker will track the set recurrence time against the time now. If it exceeds, current expenses will be reset. Else,
nothing will be done.

* Recurrence time is set by `setRecurrenceFrequency()`. If it has not been set before, the next recurrence time will
be set to `currentTime` + `recurrenceFrequency`.
* If it has already been set, the timing will be updated on the next occurrence time

Given below is a sequence diagram and step by step explanation of how Expense Tracker executes when a user sets a recurrence frequency.

.Sequence diagram of a user setting a recurrence frequency.
image::implementation/SetRecurringBudgetCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

. User enters command `setRecurrenceFrequency min/1`. The command is received by `ExpenseTrackerParser`

. `ExpenseTrackerParser` will then create a `SetRecurringBudgetCommandParser` Object and calls `SetRecurringBudgetCommandParser#parse()` method.

. `SetRecurringBudgetCommandParser#parse()` method calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to tokenize the input String into keywords and store them in
an `ArgumentMultimap` Object.

. `SetRecurringBudgetCommandParser#parse()` method then calls `SetRecurringBudgetCommandParser#areAnyPrefixesPresent()`
method. If none of the keywords are present, `ParseException` will be thrown.

. From the previous step, if no exception is thrown, `ParseUtil#parseHours()`, `ParseUtil#parseMinutes()` and
`ParseUtil#parseSeconds()` will be called to convert the number of hours in seconds, `hours`, the number of minutes in
seconds, `minutes`,
and seconds, `seconds`, respectively.

. A `SetRecurringBudgetCommand` Object with `hours+minutes+seconds` as a parameter is created and
returned to
`LogicManager`.

. `LogicManager` then calls `SetRecurringBudgetCommand#execute()`,which calls `ModelManager#setRecurrenceFrequency()`
method to update the time when the next expenses of `totalBudget` is reset.

===== Setting a Budget by Category

An extension to the budget feature, this allows the user to divide their budget based on categories. Users can
allocate parts of their budget to certain categories.
If the user's total expenses for a Category exceeds their Category Budget, a warning will be shown to the user.


. User enters command `setCategoryBudget c/School b/2.00`. The command is received by `ExpenseTrackerParser`

. `ExpenseTrackerParser` will then create a `AddCategoryBudgetCommandParser` Object and calls
`AddCategoryBudgetCommandParser#parse()` method.

. `AddCategoryBudgetCommandParser#parse()` method calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to tokenize the input String
into keywords and store them in an `ArgumentMultimap` Object.

. `AddCategoryBudgetCommandParser#parse()` method then calls `AddCategoryBudgetCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent()`
method. If any of the keywords are missing, `ParseException` will be thrown.

. From the previous step, if no exception is thrown, an `AddCategoryBudgetCommand` Object with `category` and `budget`
 is created and returned to `LogicManager`.

. `LogicManager` then calls `AddCategoryBudgetCommand#execute()`,which calls `ModelManager#setCategoryBudget()`
method to add a `Budget` to a `Category`.

===== Notification center (Proposed)
There is an area for the app to display notifications and additional information to the users beside the usual
area below the command box. This is particularly useful to the *Budget* feature as budgets should not obstruct the
usage of Expense Tracker, but rather provide helpful information. For example, if a user exceeds his total budget
 after
 adding an expense, a warning would be displayed in the *Notification center* instead of the area below the command
 box, replacing the success message of adding an expense and confusing the user.

==== Alternatives considered
Recurrence check was initially implemented via events. Every time `ModelManager#loadUserData()` is called, an event
will be sent to `EventBus` to be dispatched to an event handler implemented in `Budget`. However, after heavy
consideration, the recurrence check should only be called whenever `loadUserData()` is called, and never anywhere
else. Therefore, it should be more closely coupled with `loadUserData()` instead of being an event that can be posted
 from anywhere inside the application.

// end::budget[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
[NOTE]
Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the `config.json` file.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu, or press kbd:[Ctrl+P] to open up the print window. A menu looking
like the figure below should show up.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the figure above.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes]
 which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered. These attributes are described in the table below:

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes

|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.
Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.
These attributes are described in the table below:

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

To run all tests, carry out the following steps: +

. Right-click on the `src/test/java` folder
. Click on `Run 'All Tests'` on the menu that appears

To run a subset of tests, carry out the following steps: +

. Right-click on a test package, test class, or a test
. Click on `Run 'TEST'`, where TEST is the name of the test package, class or method you are intending to test

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

To use Gradle to run tests, carry out the following steps: +

. Open a console
. If you are on windows, enter the command `gradlew clean allTests`, otherwise enter `./gradlew clean allTests` instead

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Using the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, carry out the following steps: +

. Open a console
. If you are on windows, enter the command `gradlew clean headless allTests`, otherwise enter `./gradlew clean headless allTests` instead

=== Types of tests

There are two main types of tests:

*  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
** _System Tests_ which test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
** _Unit tests_ which test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
*  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
**  _Unit tests_ which target the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
**  _Integration tests_ which check the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
**  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
This section includes common issues that arise during testing.

* Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.

** Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
** Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

We use Gradle for build automation. See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more details.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
We use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request has changes to asciidoc files. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Follow the steps below to create a new release:

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  Create a new release using GitHub and upload the JAR file you created. See https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/
for more details.

=== Managing Dependencies

Expense Tracker depends on many third-party libraries. e.g. We use http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing in Expense Tracker.
Below are different ways to manage these _dependencies_:

* Use Gradle to manage these _dependencies_. Gradle can download the dependencies automatically. (this is better than other alternatives) +
* Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
* Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
