By: `Team W10-2`      Since: `AUG 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your restaurantal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteRestaurant.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteRestaurantEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RestaurantListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a restaurant) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteRestaurantSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
// tag::yewwoeiModel[]
// tag::chelchia(1)[]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagramWithJio.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Restaurant>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
// end::chelchia(1)[]
// end::yewwoeiModel[]

=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the User data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

// tag::evanmok2401(1)[]
== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain components and features are implemented.

=== Storage Component Design
==== Current Implementation
The storage of Makan book is split into two different xml files namely `users.xml` and `addressbook.xml` where data
relating to users are stored in the formal and data relating to restaurants are stored in the latter.

===== Aspect: Ease of Maintenance
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Split Storage into into two different components.
** Dividing storage into two different components meant the creation of multiple other classes
for the storing of data relating to users such as `UserData` and `XmlSerializableUsers`.
** However, this was deemed necessary and appropriate as User and Restaurant is abstracted out and encapsulated.
Should there be a reset of Users, the restaurant data would remain unaffected.
** Pros: Abstraction of Data that are separate.
** Pros: Easier to maintain.
** Cons: Time costs to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Storing the data of Users and Restaurants in the same `addressbook.xml` file.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: Difficult to maintain and scale. All sorts of data relating to users will be stored together with restaurants.

=== Write Review Feature
==== Current Implementation
The write review feature allows a user to write a review about a restaurant. This review
is available for all users in the Makan Book to view. This review is then stored internally into
the restaurant addressbook and the current user. When the command writeReview is called and executed,
the model manager creates an UserReview (to be stored in restaurant addressbook) and a RestaurantReview
(to be stored into User) as seen in the sequence diagram below.

image::WriteReviewSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Additionally, a restaurant contains an overall rating, the average rating of all the reviews it has.
The activity diagram below describes the process of updating the restaurant's overall rating.

image::AddUserReviewToRestaurantActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Where to store User Review

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the review in both User and restaurant addressbook.
** Pros: Greater abstraction and encapsulation of Data
** Pros: Ease of displaying the list of reviews that a specific User has written
** Pros: Ease of displaying the list of reviews of a specific Restaurant
** Pros: Ease of updating the Overall Rating of a Restaurant
** Cons: Contains a number of repeated code. +
*** E.g. UserReview and RestaurantReview are identical except that UserReview stores the Restaurant Name
while RestaurantReview stores the Username of the User.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the review in restaurant adddressbook.
** Pros: Ease of Implementation (Significantly fewer classes)
** Cons: Cluttered Storage of Data making it difficult to maintain and scale

=== Sign Up, Login and Logout Feature
==== Current Implementation
The current implementation of Makan Book does not allow the usage of all the features. Certain features require registration
or login of an account. For instance, the adding of friends can only be done upon log in. Sign Up, Login and Logout commands
can be entered through the Command Line Interface. The implementation is aided by the current `modelManager` which keeps track
of whether a user is currently signed in and which user it is. In doing so, data relating to this particular user during his session
can be saved.
// end::evanmok2401(1)[]

// tag::meena567[]
=== Adding, accepting and deleting friends and friend requests
==== Current Implementation for Friendships
Friendships can have two statuses - ACCEPTED and PENDING. User A can send a friend request to User B which would then store
a friendship with User A as PENDING under User B alone. User B can choose to accept or delete the friend request. If User
chooses to delete the friend request, the PENDING friendship under User B will be deleted. If User B chooses to accept the
friend request, the friendship status will be changed from PENDING to ACCEPTED for User B and an identical friendship will
be added to User A, the one who initiated the friendship.

image::AddFriendCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Now moving on to deletion of friends. Assuming that two Users C and D are friends with each other, and User C deletes his
or her friendship with User D. This would delete the friendship stored under both User C and User D even if User D did not
initiate the deletion of friendship. It is also possible to list the existing list of friends (ACCEPTED) and friend
requests (PENDING).

The Friendship class itself stores 'me' (currently logged in User), 'friendUser' (other party in the friendship),
'friendshipStatus' (status of the friendship) and 'initiatedBy' (which party the friendship was initiated by).
There is a restriction such that the 'initiatedBy' must be either 'me' or 'friendUser'. A friendship is immutable once
created. Friendships are stored as an XML element under users.xml with the four attributes mentioned above.

==== Why the current implementation for Friendships
The PENDING friendships are only stored under the User who did not initiate the friendship. This so that when the
listFriendRequests command is called so as to allow the User to accept and delete the friend requests accordingly,
it only makes sense for the User to see the friendships that they wish to accept or delete (i.e. friendships not
initiated by them). Thus, friend requests are only stored under the User who did not initiate the friendship.

There are two separate lists for friendships - one for friend requests and one for friends. This is to aid the listing
functions and avoid confusion by simplifying the friendships stored under User.

===== Exceptions and why they are thrown
There are several exceptions thrown for the friendship commands. An exception is thrown for all friendship commands
should there be no User logged in currently. Specifically for the adding of friends (i.e. sending
friend requests) a User cannot send a request to himself. Moreover, if the User has previously sent a request which has
yet to be accepted by the other User, the initiating User cannot send another request. However, if the recipient User
has deleted the friend request, then the initiating User is able to send a new friend request. A blocking feature is to
be made in v2.0. Moreover, a User cannot send a friend request to another User with whom they are already friends with.

When it comes to accepting friendships, there are several exceptions thrown too. If the User tries to accept a friend
request not in their list of friend requests an exception is thrown. Similarly, an exception is thrown if the User tries
to delete a friend request not in their list of friend requests or a friend who is not in their list of friends.

==== Alternatives considered for Friendships
For a while, I considered storing all friendships (both friend requests and friends) in the same list. However, I decided
against this as this made things potentially confusing especially for a new developer coming in to retrieve only friends
or friend requests.

===== XML storage
Initially, I faced a problem balancing making the code more OOP (to preserve the true spirit of software engineering) and
storing friendships as an XML element. XML elements only take in Strings and not objects. However to store friendships,
the elements stored include Users ('friendUser', 'me' and 'initiatedBy'). Thus, I considered sacrificing the OOP-nature
of Friendships as proposed above and instead merely storing usernames as strings for the User.

To get around this problem, a hashmap mapping Username to the User is passed to the class doing the XML storage and loading
of Friendships. Thus, OOP is not sacrificed as User is still the data type of the attributes stored in Friendship and
Friendships can be created from the XML element with the aid of the hashmap.

Initially, I considered asking the initiating User to enter all the information about the other User to add them as a friend.
This is so that I would be able to construct the User from the the information provided. However, this would be too
inconvenient for the User and thus the hashmap mentioned before was used.
// end::meena567[]

// tag::kate[]
=== Payment Splitting Feature

==== Current Implementation
The payment splitting feature allow user to keep record for their debts, especially for gathering. Creditor can use
the `addDebt` to create a request to debtor, or `addGroupDebt` to create a request to all other members in a group.
A record of this debt will be made with a "pending" status and store to
both user.

image::AddDebtCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Debtor can then use the `acceptDebtRequest` to accept the request from creditor, which the status will be
changed to "accepted", or reject and delete the request by `deleteDebtRequest`, which the the debt record will be
deleted and removed from the storage. If the debt has been repaid, the creditor can use the `clearDebt` to mark the
debt as "cleared". Only the user who initialized the debt(creditor) can clear the debt, and only the other user(debtor)
can accept or delete the debt. An accepted debt needed to be confirmed by both users.

==== How the feature is implemented
The Debt class store creditor, debtor, amount, status and id(timestamp).
The creditor and debtor must be a user, amount should be larger than zero,
there are four status - `PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, `CLEARED` and `BALANCED` and the id is a 15 digits long string to identify the debt.
Debts are stored as an XML element under users.xml with all the above attributes mentioned as a string.

==== Why it is implemented that way
The debt is under `PENDING` when it is created, it is treated as a request to the debtor. The debtor needs to accept
and make it to a `ACCEPTED` debt. The `ACCEPTED` debt need to be confirm by both side because we want to ensure its
accuracy. Also, only the user who initialize the debt(creditor) can clear the debt to prevent the debtor clear or delete
it for self benefit.

==== Alternatives considered.
===== Alternative 1: The debt can create by one user and do not need to be accepted
* Pros:
** Easy to store
** Easy to mange
* Cons:
** Lost accuracy
** Not fair to user

===== Alternative 2: The debt store separately instead of under user
* Pros:
** Easy to store
** Easy to retrieve
** Easy to implement
* Cons:
** Cannot achieve confirmation by user
** It is cumbersome to user

// end::kate[]

// tag::yewwoeiDate[]
=== Internal Representation of Dates
==== Current Implementation
Each date consists of three points of data: the NUS Week, the Day of the week, and the Time of the day.
The dates are separated into 30 minute intervals as represented by the time. The time is stored in 24-hour format.

This implementation means that MakanBook is only tailored to work during the NUS semester. All features requiring some aspect of time
will use this Date implementation.

==== Reasons for this implementation
Dates follow the NUS calendar to make it very intuitive for NUS students. Furthermore, this opens up ease of integrating with
NUS mods in the future.

Time-intervals are set at 30 minutes to ease implementation and reduce storage needs.

==== Restrictions on usage of Date.
Dates are all limited to the NUS calendar, and no dates in the range of 0000 to 0600 hours can be created.
The rational for this is to discourage improper sleeping hours among students in NUS – at least in that small window of time.

==== Alternatives considered
Another alternative considered was to use the Calendar library in Java to store the dates as an underlying data structure. However,
as the NUS week system would be the most intuitive way of user input for students, this may only create additional work.
// end::yewwoeiDate[]

// tag::chelchia(2)[]
=== Jio Feature
==== Current Implementation
A `Jio` object stores information about the jio in the following objects: `Name`, `Week`, `Day`, `Time`, `Address`. The
`Jio` object also stores the people going on the jio as a list of `Username`. A `Jio` object cannot be modified after
creation, except to add a user (ie. append `Username` to the list). Jios are stored in the users.xml with each object
as an Xml element.

Creator (current user) is automatically added to the jio. If the group tag `g/` is added, users under the group specified is retrieved from `UserData` and added to the jio.

image::CreateJioCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Jio-related Commands
`createJio` is implemented by creating a `Jio` object with the specified parameters, but an empty list of `Username`.
The `Jio` object is eventually passed to `ModelManager`, which adds the current user to the `Jio` and stores it in `UserData`.
Similarly, `joinJio` relies on `ModelManager` to add the current user to the jio. It also performs a check that the
user is not already in the list of `Username`, otherwise a `CommandException` is thrown.
All jio commands require the user to be logged in due to usage of current user, otherwise a `NotLoggedInCommandException`
is thrown. `joinJio` and `deleteJio` perform additional checks for whether the `Jio` exists, otherwise a `CommandException`
is thrown.

==== Reasons for this implementation
`ModelManager` exclusively handles all operations related to current user for encapsulation. Thus, the command classes
do not touch current user at all, but pass `Jio` objects on to `ModelManager`.

==== Alternatives Considered
===== Aspect: Storing jio

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Jios are stored separately.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Pros: Easy to retrieve jio from storage by searching for jio name.
** Pros: Jio can listed easily.
** Cons: Jio creator needs to be stored as an additional attribute if needed.
* **Alternative 2:** Storing jios in User.
** Pros: A jio can be identified by its creator
** Cons: Difficult to list jios. Need to iterate through users.
** Cons: Hard to retrieve a particular jio.

===== Aspect: Storing people going on jio

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** List of Username.
** Pros: Easy to implement and list.
** Cons: Users must have unique usernames.
* **Alternative 2:** Storing a list of User instead.
** Pros: All information about User is stored for possible retrieval in the future (eg. to view user timetables).
** Cons: Difficult to store in Xml file. Users cannot easily be converted in to a single string.
** Cons: May be storing unnecessary information.
// end::chelchia(2)[]

// tag::yewwoeiFeature[]
=== User Schedule Feature

==== Benefits for the user
* Any user using our MakanBook can add their schedules into their profile to block out dates that they are not free.
* This way, any other person wanting to eat with other users can easily see which times they are free at.
* To help the user arrange eating times with their groups, the user can also run the `findDates` command to find common timeslots to
 eat at for groups.

==== Current Implementation
In MakanBook, we implemented a schedule feature according to the NUS Calendar: 17 weeks in a semester, with each day
split into 30 minute timeslots as mentioned above. Each timeslot is encapsulated by a `Date` object which contains the NUS `Week`, the `Day` of the week, and the `Time` that the 30 minute segment starts at.

A `UniqueSchedule` class is then used to encapsulate the list of busy timeslots for any individual user and `UniqueSchedule` contains two key pieces of information:
the `Username` to identify which user the schedule belongs to, and a `HashMap` that stores the list of busy `Dates` for
each corresponding NUS week.

image::BlockDateSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


**Storage of Timetable related Data** +
The entire user's `UniqueSchedule` is stored in the users.xml file with each object as an XML element containing the username and all busy dates.

**Algorithm for finding free timeslots to eat** +
Currently, each time `listScheduleForUser` or `findDates` is run, the system will retrieve the list of all unavailable dates for that NUS week.
Then, a complete list of free dates will be generated for that week. The list of blocked dates will be run against the complete free list, removing all blocked dates before the UI
receives the finalised list to display.

==== Reasons for this Implementation
All lists of dates are stored in a `List` instead of a `Set`. In the future, utilising `Set` may be a safer alternative to completely prevent the possibility of duplicates.
Currently, duplicate dates are checked through the `contains` method of `List`. Any programming violations are checked in the test suite.

`Set` data structures are not currently used as it will not interact well with the current XML storage system. For lack of time, this low-priority consideration will be set aside.

==== Timetable Commands
* `BlockDateCommand` is specific to the logged in user, allowing the current `User` to save a date on his schedule where he is not free. A `BlockDateCommandParser` is used to parse the arguments necessary.
* `FreeDateCommand` is specific to the logged in user, allowing him to free up dates on his schedule. A `FreeDateCommandParser` is used to parse the arguments necessary.
* `ListScheduleForWeek` is specific to the logged in user. The command lists the user's schedule for a given NUS week. A parser is necessary.
* `FindDates` finds common dates to eat between all users the group is in. The command lists all free timeslots to eat for a given NUS week, among the NUS group. A parser is necessary.

==== Restrictions on usage of Timetable commands
Timetable Commands can only be used when the `User` is logged into the MakanBook.
Exceptions are handled with the `NotLoggedInCommandException` class in the `Logic` component.

The algorithm for finding all the free dates for a user or group is found inside the UniqueSchedule class.

// end::yewwoeiFeature[]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all restaurants in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/restaurant/Restaurant.java[`Restaurant`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a restaurant, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/restaurant/Restaurant.java[`Restaurant`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each restaurant, and remove the `tag` from each restaurant.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last restaurant in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside restaurant cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**

image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/RestaurantCard.java[the `RestaurantCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `RestaurantCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of restaurants when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of restaurants whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of restaurants status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a restaurant specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first restaurant to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first restaurant.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `RestaurantCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/RestaurantCard.java[`RestaurantCard`] s to display a remark for each restaurant later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/RestaurantListCard.fxml[`RestaurantListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/RestaurantCard.java[`RestaurantCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/RestaurantCardHandle.java[`RestaurantCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/restaurant/Restaurant.java[`Restaurant`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/restaurant/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Restaurant` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/restaurant/Restaurant.java[`Restaurant`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/restaurant/Restaurant.java[`Restaurant`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the restaurant will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedRestaurant` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Restaurant` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedRestaurant.java[`XmlAdaptedRestaurant`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidRestaurantAddressBook.xml`, `typicalRestaurantsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `RestaurantBuilder`
Since `Restaurant` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/RestaurantBuilder.java[`RestaurantBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/restaurant/Restaurant.java[`Restaurant`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/RestaurantBuilder.java[`RestaurantBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the restaurant that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Restaurant` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalRestaurants.java[`TypicalRestaurants`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `RestaurantCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/RestaurantCard.java[`RestaurantCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/RestaurantCard.java[`RestaurantCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Restaurant` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysRestaurant(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a restaurant.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* Diners aiming to find eating places around the National University of Singapore

*Value proposition*:

With the Makan Book, users can find restaurants based on their preferences such as cuisine or budget. This makes the process of deciding what to eat easier. At the same time, users can give reviews of the restaurants and can view reviews of other users as well.
Additionally, Users can add other users as friends and form groups so that they can have private food “Jios”/ sessions. Public food “Jios”, which is open to the whole of NUS, is available as well for the User. Additionally, the User can get recommendations for friends based on mutual friends or others who eat at the same restaurants. Users of the addressbook can also include their own timetable to help them organise jios and eating sessions with friends. Lastly, a user can add restaurants apart from the existing NUS restaurants in their own private Restaurant book. Through the features of the Restaurant Book, we hope the dining experience in NUS can be enhanced.
