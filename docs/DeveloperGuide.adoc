== Introduction

Welcome to Car Park Finder's developer guide!

=== What is Car Park Finder
Car Park Finder is an application to find HDB (Housing Development Board) car parks in Singapore. It allows you to
work with a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* to display a list of car parks by typing. It enables the following:

* Viewing of car park information through typing.
* Searching and filtering by location and keywords.

== Setting up
This section describes the steps needed to set up the application.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed by default. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repository and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project
dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources`
(Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish
with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedCarpark.java[`XmlAdaptedCarpark.java`]
and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the
newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. kbd:[ALT + ENTER]
and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well
(e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`]
and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors,
and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

* Run the `seedu.parking.MainApp` and try a few commands
* <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code
Here are some tips to before writing code for an easier time.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design
This section explains the design architecture and various components of the system.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture overview

This section explains the design architecture used by the entire system.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.


.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_architecture diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App,
 which contains 6 <<Architecture-Components,*`architecture components`*>> and
 adopts an <<Architecture-design,*`events-driven nature`*>>.

[[Architecture-Components]]
=== Architecture components

This section will briefly introduce the function of each architecture components
as well as common behaviours.

.Architecture Components
|===
|Component |Main Function

|<<Design-Main,*`Main`*>>
|the starting point of the system, which encapsulates the other components.

|<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>>
|represents a collection of classes used by multiple components.

|<<Design-Ui,*`User Interface`*>>
|contains the user interface classes used by the application.

|<<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>
|execute user commands, also known as the command executor.

|<<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>
|holds the data of the application in-memory.

|<<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>
|which allows reading and writing of data to the hard disk.
|===

[NOTE]
Each of the User Interface, Logic, Model, Storage Components also:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the *_class diagram_* given below) defines it's API in the `Logic` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Architecture-design]]
=== Events-driven nature of the design

This section explains the main nature of design adopted by the system.

The *_sequence diagram_* below shows how the components interact when the user issues the command `find sengkang`.

.Component interactions for `find sengkang` command (part 1)
image::Sequence diagram - Find Carpark.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `CarparkFinderChangedEvent` when the Car Park Finder data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The *_sequence diagram_* below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `find sengkang` command (part 2)
image::Sequence diagram - Find Carpark Event Handling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how the Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Main]]
=== Main component

The `Main` component consists of only one class, link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them with one another.
* At shut down: shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Commons component

The `Commons` component consists of classes used by multiple other components. Two of these classes play important roles at the architectural level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

[NOTE]
Classes used by multiple components are put in the seedu.carparkfinder.commons package.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== User interface component

The `User Interface` (`UI`) component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of different parts.
The base class
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`] uses _JavaFx UI_ framework.

Please refer to the *_class diagram_* below for more details on how they are connected.

.Structure of the User Interface component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

In general, this is the workflow of the `UI` component:

. Execute user commands using the `Logic` component.
. Bind itself to some data in the `Model` so that the `UI` components can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
. Respond to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the `UI` components accordingly.

All `UI` parts, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. The layout for each
component is defined in matching `.fxml` files and can be found in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.

For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`]
is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The `Logic` component consist of a `LogicManager` that takes care of the parse and exexcution of commands.
It inherits the base class link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`].

Please refer to the *_class diagram_* below for more details on how they are connected.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

In general, this is the workflow of the `Logic` component:

.  Get the `CarparkFinderParser` class to parse the user command.
.  Create a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  Pass the result of the command execution over to `Model`, which can affect it (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  Return the command execution by encapsulating the command as a `CommandResult` object which then is passed back to the `UI`.

The *_sequence diagram_* below shows the interactions within the `Logic` component
when `execute("delete 1")` is called.

.Sequence Diagram of of `execute("delete 1")
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The `Model` component is managed by the `ModelManager` that stores the data of Car Park Finder.
It does not depend on any of the three other components.
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`] is the base class.


Please refer to the *_class diagram_* below for more details.

.Structure of the Model Component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


In general, this is the structure of the `Model` Component:

* The `ModelManager` extends the `Model` Interface.

* It stores a `VersionedCarparkFinder` and a `UserPref` object.
** The `UserPref` object represents the user's preferences.
** The `VersionedCarparkFinder` contains a `carparkFinderStateList` which is used to store multiple `Carpark` objects.


* The `ModelManager` also manages a filtered list of `Carpark` objects filtered from the `carparkFinderStateList`.

* The `Model component` exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Carpark>` that can be 'observed'
e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that it automatically updates when data in the list changes.


[NOTE]
As a OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in Car Park Finder, which `Carpark` can reference.
This would allow Car Park Finder to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of
each `Carpark` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below.
 +

.Use of Tag object
image::ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]



[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The `Storage` component, managed by the `StorageManager`, serves as a backend storage for data of Car Park Finder.
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`] is the base class.

Please refer to the *_class diagram_* below for more details on how they are connected.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[localcopy]]
The `Storage` component can perform the following functions:

* save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* save the Car Park Finder data in xml format and read it back.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
This section describes how the Undo/Redo feature is implemented for the car park finder.

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCarparkFinder`.
It extends `CarparkFinder` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `carparkFinderStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCarparkFinder#commit()` -- Saves the current car park finder state in its history.
* `VersionedCarparkFinder#undo()` -- Restores the previous car park finder state from its history.
* `VersionedCarparkFinder#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone car park finder state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCarparkFinder()`, `Model#undoCarparkFinder()` and `Model#redoCarparkFinder()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCarparkFinder` will be initialized with the initial car park finder state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single car park finder state.

The following diagram showcases the state at the start of the program.

.State and the start of the program
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagramNew1.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `find sengkang` command to find list of car park which contain sengkang from the car park finder. The `find` command calls `Model#updateFilteredCarparkList()`, causing the modified state of the car park finder after the `find sengkang` command executes to be saved in the `carparkFinderStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted car park finder state.

The following diagram shows a new state is created after the command `find segkang` is ran.

.State after running find command
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagramNew2.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `clear` to clear all entries. The `clear` command also calls `Model#commitCarparkFinder()`, causing another modified car park finder state to be saved into the `carparkFinderStateList`.

The following diagram shows a new state is created after the command `clear` is ran.

.State after running find then clear command
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagramNew3.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCarparkFinder()`, so the car park finder state will not be saved into the `carparkFinderStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCarparkFinder()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous car park finder state, and restores the car park finder to that state.

The following diagram shows a new state is created after the command `undo` is ran. The state pointer is moved.

.How the undo feature works in a diagram
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagramNew4.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial car park finder state, then there are no previous car park finder states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCarparkFinder()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence diagram of Undo/Redo feature
image::Sequence Diagram - Undo.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoCarparkFinder()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the car park finder to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `carparkFinderStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest car park finder state, then there are no undone car park finder states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCarparkFinder()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the car park finder, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCarparkFinder()`, `Model#undoCarparkFinder()` or `Model#redoCarparkFinder()`. Thus, the `carparkFinderStateList` remains unchanged.

The follow diagram showcases what happen when a command that does not modify the state is used.

.As the command does nothing, the state is not changed, but a new state is introduced
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagramNew5.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCarparkFinder()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `carparkFinderStateList`, all car park finder states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `find sengkang` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following diagram showcases when a new command is used after an undo.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire car park finder.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Easy to implement.
|Cons| May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
|===


* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Will use less memory (e.g. for `select`, just save the car park being selected).
|Cons| We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
|===

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of car park finder states.

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
|Cons| Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedCarparkFinder`.
|===

* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo

[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
|Cons| Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
|===
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::query[]
=== Query feature

The `query` command updates the information of every car park using the latest information provided by
_data.gov.sg_ database.

==== Overview

The mechanism does an API call to the website _data.gov.sg_ to obtain car park information in `JSON` format.
An external library `Gson` is used to parse the data in `GsonUtil`. The data is stored internally as a `CarparkJson` object.

Some notable methods that `GsonUtil` implement are:

* `GsonUtil#getCarparkData()` — Get the basic car park information from the API.
* `GsonUtil#getCarparkAvailability()` — Get the total number of parking lots as well as the availability of the parking lots from another API.
* `GsonUtil#fetchCarparkInfo()` — Return a list of car parks with populated data.
* `GsonUtil#loadCarparkPostalCode` — Return a list of postal code information, with hashed coordinate data.

Only `GsonUtil#fetchCarparkInfo()` is exposed in `QueryCommand`, inside `QueryCommand#readCarpark()` method.

[TIP]
A <<localcopy, local copy>> of the data is saved at the end. Users only need to execute this command if they want to get the most recent information from the database.

==== Example

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the query mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application, where the initial state of _Car Park Finder_ is not up-to-date
with the latest data published by _data.gov.sg_.

Step 2. The user executes the `query` command to fetch the latest data. The `query` command calls
`GsonUtil#fetchCarparkInfo()` which in turn runs `GsonUtil#getCarparkData()` and `GsonUtil#getCarparkAvailability()`.

Step 3. The user waits for data to be updated. `GsonUtil#getCarparkData()` establishes a connection with the API
to read `JSON` data containing basic car park information.

[NOTE]
If `GsonUtil#getCarparkData()` fails to read from the API, IOException would be thrown.

Step 4. The `JSON` data is parsed using `Gson` library and stored inside `CarparkJson`. A `HashSet` is used to consolidate
all the car parks and prevent duplicate entries.

Step 5. Once `GsonUtil#getCarparkData()` is done getting all the basic car park information,
`GsonUtil#getCarparkAvailability()` retrieves additional details of the parking lot. The process is similar to how `GsonUtil#getCarparkData()` retrieves data from the API.

Step 6. `GsonUtil#getCarparkAvailability()` appends the additional the parking lot details using `CarparkJson#addOn()`

Step 7. Next, a final check is done to see if there is any car park with no parking lot data. The value 0 is added if there is no data.

Step 8. Finally an `ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>` is returned from `GsonUtil#fetchCarparkInfo()` to update the car park finder state.
 The line of text at the bottom of the application then will show that the application is updated.

Please refer to the _Sequence Diagram_ below for the `query` operation.

For more details on the internal workings of `Model` please refer to `undo`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How query executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Wait for data to be queried sequentially.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Easy to implement.
|Cons| Application hangs while data is being queried.
|===

* **Alternative 2 :** Data is queried using a separate thread.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Application can continue to function as the data is being fetched in the background.
|Cons| Reading the car park list while querying might cause unintended side effects if not handled properly.
|===

===== Aspect: Data structure to support query command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>` to store car park information.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Easy to maintain and iterate through an array list of array lists to get a specific car park.
|Cons| Using an `ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>` can be confusing and unintuitive. Accessing elements is also not that efficient.
|===

* **Alternative 2 :** Use a `HashMap<String,Carpark>` to store data.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Much more efficient in accessing elements by using a key and better code readability.
|Cons| `HashMap` does not provide an ordered collection.
|===
// end::query[]

// tag::notify[]
=== Notify feature

The notify feature updates specific car parks.

==== Overview

The notify mechanism will fetch data from the API every interval. The interval can be set in terms of seconds/minutes
and is used in conjunction with the `select` command.

This means that it will only notify the current selected car park only, and not all the car parks.

==== Example

|===
// end::notify[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find feature

The find feature searches for a car park by keyword or location.

==== Overview

The find mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommand` and `FindCommandParser`. It extends `Command` and implements the following operations:

* `FindCommand#execute()` -- Executes the command by running a predicate `CarparkContainsKeywordsPredicate` to update the car park list.

The find mechanism is supported by `FindCommandParser`. It implements `Parser` and contains the following operations:

* `FindCommandParser#parse()` -- Checks the arguments for empty strings and throws a `ParseException` if empty string is found. It then splits it by one or more white spaces. It then removes any strings in the list of common words.

The predicate `CarparkContainsKeywordsPredicate` takes in a list of strings and checks if any of the strings matches the name or address of a car park fully or partially.

.How the find operation works
image::seqdiagram-find.png[width="800", align="left"]

The diagram above describes how the flow of a find command would execute. It rely on `FindCommandParser` to ensure the variables are correct.

==== Example

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the Find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `find punggol` command to get all car parks in punggol.
The `find` command calls `FindCommandParser#parse()`.

[NOTE]
If a command execution fails, it will not call `FindCommand#execute()`, and the car park finder state will not be saved.

Step 3. The entire list of car parks is filtered by the predicate `CarparkContainsKeywordsPredicate`, which checks for the keyword `punggol`.

Step 4. The filtered list of car parks is returned to the GUI.

The flow chart below describes the user interaction with the application and how it processes it.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How predicate works

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Predicate have additional filter with an ignore list.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Re-usable functions introduced for partial checking.
|Cons| Reading the car park list while querying might cause unintended side effects if not handled properly.

* **Alternative 2:** Filter the data when it is taken in.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Easy to maintain as predicate will have lesser conditions.
|Cons| Breaks OOP style as the parser will modify the data.
|===
+
// end::find[]

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter feature

The filter feature allow users to find a suitable car park based on criteria that users input, within a certain area.


==== Overview
The filter mechanism is facilitated by `FilterCommand` and `FilterCommandParser`.
The filter mechanism can filter car parks by the following criteria. The corresponding flag of each criterion is also
indicated below.

* Car park has available parking slots `a/`
* Car park has short-term parking `s/`
* Type of car park `ct/`
* Car park has free parking between a specified time period `f/`
* Car park has night parking `n/`
* Type of parking system that the car park uses `ps/`

The `FilterCommandParser` extends `Parser` and implements the following operation:

* `FilterCommandParser#parse()` -- Splits the arguments by white spaces and store them into an array list.
Parser then checks the validity of the arguments input by user, and throws a `ParseException` when arguments are deemed invalid in various ways.

The `FilterCommand` extends `Command` and implements the following operation:

* `FilterCommand#execute()` -- Executes the command by filtering the car park list with `CarparkFilteringPredicate`.

The `FilterCommand` is able to filter car parks by multiple criteria at a time.


==== Current Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the filter mechanism behaves at each step when filtering with the following criteria:

* car park is covered
* car park has free parking between Sunday 11.30am and 3.30pm
* car park currently has available parking slot

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `filter ct/ COVERED f/ SUN 11.30AM 3.30PM a/`.

[NOTE]
Input parameters can also be in lower case as `FilterCommandParser` will convert input parameters to upper case
if they are not.

Step 3. After `CarparkFinderParser` detects `filter` as the command word, a
`FilterCommandParser` is created to parse the arguments supplied to the command.

Step 4. The `FilterCommandParser` splits the arguments by white spaces and store them into `List<String> argumentsList`.

Step 5. Then, it identifies the flags  present in `List<String> argumentsList` and store them in `List<String> flagList`.

[NOTE]
If `List<String> flagList` is empty, `FilterCommandParser` throws a `ParseException` to indicatte that the command has invalid parameters.

Step 6. `FilterCommandParser` also parses the parameter(s) of each flag, and throws `ParseException` when necessary.

* `ct/`: `FilterCommandParser` ensures that `COVERED` is a valid car park type.
* `f/`: `FilterCommandParser` ensures that `SUN` is a valid day and `11.30AM` and `3.30PM` are valid times.
Moreover, `FilterCommandParser` ensures that all three parameters are present.

Step 7. Parameters of `ct/` and `f/` are packaged into `CarparkTypeParameter carparkTypeParameter` and
 `FreeParkingParameter freeParkingParameter` respectively. They are then passed to a newly created `FilterCommand`
 together with `List<String> flagList`.

Step 8. The `FilterCommand` object obtains the last predicate used by `FindCommand` from `model` and creates the `CarparkFilteringPredicate`.

[NOTE]
The `ModelManager` stores the last predicate used by `FindCommand`. The predicate is updated every time `FindCommand` is executed.

Step 9. Besides filtering by the last predicate used by `FindCommand` (location), `CarparkFilteringPredicate` has a
series of `if` statements that checks which flags are present in `List<String> flagList`, before looking into
the parameters of the flags.

* For `a/`: `CarparkFilteringPredicate` checks that the car park has available parking slots.
* For `ct/`: `CarparkFilteringPredicate` checks that the car park type of the car park is `COVERED`.
* For `f/`: `CarparkFilteringPredicate` checks that the car park has free parking on Sunday, and the start and end time
input by the user falls between the free parking time period of the car park.

Step 10. To combine the filtering criteria, a boolean variable, `collective`, is used. The following snippet of code shows more clearly how it is used.

image::CarparkFilteringPredicate_code_snippet.png[width="700", align="left"]

Step 11. The list of car parks is filtered against the predicate and returned to the GUI.

Please refer to the _Sequence Diagram_ below for the filter operation.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How location based filtering is done

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Combining the location predicate from the previous `FindCommand` to form the predicate for the current `FilterCommand`
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Able to accomplish location-based filtering with less modification to existing code structure.
|Cons| Less efficient as the list of car park needs to be filtered by an additional parameter.
|===

* **Alternative 2:** Store the filtered list of car parks from `FindCommand`, then filter from there.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Improved efficiency as a shorter list of car park needs to be filtered by `FilterCommand`.
|Cons| Additional memory required to store the list of car park generated by `FindCommand`.
A whole new set of classes and methods needs to be written to store the filtered list, might over-complicate code.
|===
// end::filter[]

// tag::calculate[]
=== Calculate Feature

The calculate feature helps users calculate the cost of parking at a specific car park for a specified time period.


==== Overview

The calculate mechanism is facilitated by `CalculateCommand` and `CalculateCommandParser`.


==== Current Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the calculate mechanism behaves at each step when
the user wants to know the cost of parking at car park W49, on a Monday, from 9.00am to 5.30pm.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `calculate W49 SUN 9.00AM 5.30PM`.

Step 3. After `CarparkFinderParser` detects `calculate` as the command word, a `CalculateCommandParser` is created to
parse the arguments supplied to the command.

Step 4. The `CarparkFinderParser` splits the arguments by white spaces, then creates a `CalculateCommand` object.

Step 5. `CalculateCommand` creates a `CarparkIsOfNumberPredicate` to find the specified car park, car park W49, from
the list of car parks.

Step 6. `CalculateCommand` checks if the car park W49 has short-term parking.

Step 7. As some car parks only has short-term parking between certain timings, `CalculateCommand` checks if the parking time input by the user is valid.

Step 8. After which `CalculateCommand` checks of there is free parking on Monday between the specified time. Since there
is no free parking during that time period, it will calculate the cost of parking by the standard rate of $0.60 per half an hour.

Step 9. The calculated cost is then returned to the GUI as a command result.

The following _Activity Diagram_ summarizes the implementation of the
calculate command.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How specified car park is identified and obtained from car park list

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Identify car park by car park number. Filter list of car parks by the car park number. Then obtain the car park from filtered list.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Command can be executed independently, as long as user knows the car park number of car park.
Make use of existing filtering methods to obtain car park.
Since car park number is unique to each car park, there would only be one car park left in filtered list if car park number is valid.
|Cons| Less efficient as command needs to find the specific car park from all the car parks.
|===

* **Alternative 2:** Identify the car park by index from last filtered list.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Simple to implement, can directly obtain car park by obtaining the last filtered list from `modal` and then using the `get` method on the list.
|Cons| Command can only work after `FindCommand` or `FilterCommand` is executed.
|===

// end::calculate[]

//==== Design Considerations
//===== Aspect: How calculation is done

=== Abbreviation Feature

The abbreviation feature reduces the amount of characters needed to type.

==== Overview

The abbreviation mechanism is facilitated by `CarparkFinderParser`. It extends the cases
to allow command abbreviations to be parsed through `parseCommand` as well.

==== Example

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the abbreviation mechanism behaves at
each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `LogicManager`
is initialized with an `CarparkFinderParser`.

Step 2. The user executes `f` command instead of `find`. The `Matcher` object in
`CarparkFinderParser` splits the command text into _command word_ and
_arguments_, in which the _command word_ is parsed using a _switch_
statement.

Step 3. This _command word_ will be matched to a `COMMAND_ABBREVIATION` from
`ListCommand`, which holds the value of 'f'. As the program finds a match, it
proceeds as if a `find` command is given.

.Flow chart of command abbreviation usage.
image::ActivityDiagram-abbreviation.png[width="700", align="left"]

The _Activity Diagram_ above explains what happens when a user executes a `f`
command.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How abbreviation executes

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* declare `COMMAND_ABBREVIATION` with a string value
in each Command file.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Easy to implement
|Cons| Have to decide on each abbreviation subjectively which brings down performance
       if there are a lot of commands
|===
+

* *Alternative 2:* declare `COMMAND_ABBREVIATION` using the first two characters of `COMMAND_WORD`
in each Command file.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Better performance as abbreviations will be assigned systematically.
|Cons| When there are 2 command words starting with same two characters e.g. `find` & `filter`, this does not work.
|===

=== Autocomplete feature

The autocomplete feature simplifies overcomplicated commands by prompting correct format.

==== Overview

The autocomplete mechanism is facilitated by `CommandBox`. It calls `autocomplete()`
to `displayFormat()` if applicable command word is entered or to highlight the next
parameter if full format is already provided in the command box.

==== Example

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the autocomplete mechanism behaves at
each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user enters `fi` in command box and then presses kbd:[Tab] . `autoComplete()`
compares `input` through the list of applicable command words and abbreviations, and
proceeds to `displayFormat()` because `fi` is an applicable `COMMAND_ABBREVIATION`. It
moves on to highlight its first placeholder, `DAY`, in the command line. As seen
from the following diagrams.

.After `fi` is entered.
image::screenshot-fi.png[width="700", align="left"]

.After kbd:[Tab] is pressed for the first time.
image::screenshot-fiFirstArgSelected.png[width="700", align="left"]

Step 3. The user replaces `DAY` with an actual value, `SUN`, and presses 'Tab'
key again. `autoComplete()` is called again, but because this time it checks that `input`
`isFilterCommandFormat`, the next placeholder, `START_TIME`, is highlighted. Result
is shown in the following diagram.

.After kbd:[Tab] is pressed for the second time.
image::screenshot-fiSecondArgSelected.png[width="700", align="left"]

Step 4. The user continues step 3 until all placeholders are filled up with actual
values and then presses kbd:[Enter]  to execute this command.

image::ActivityDiagram-autocompletion.png[width="700", align="left"]

The _Activity Diagram_ above explains what happens when user presses kbd:[Tab].

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: TextInput

* *Alternative 1:* (current choice): Continue to use the original TextField
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| External library enables bindAutocompletion for TextField (the drop down
list of suggested commands that appears and updates itself as user types).
External library enables bindAutocompletion for TextField (the drop down list of
 suggested commands that appears and updates itself as user types).
|Cons| Text formatting is limited. All text in the TextField must have the same format.
|===

* *Alternative 2:* Create additional TextField as user request for additional fields
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Allows for different formatting for different fields (Commands can have a
 different colour from the fields)
|Cons|Original structure will be disrupted. Command box will no longer be single
line text input, which have consequences such as the user cannot backspace or
select through the entire line.
|===

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).


// tag::postalcode[]
[[Implementation-PostalCode]]
=== Postal Code
The postal code feature is built to allow easier finding of car park by knowing the postal code they are searching for.
As the car park data from `data.gov.sg` does not have any postal code, we converted coordinates of each respective
car park to a postal code whenever possible.

==== Overview
Currently, postal code data are stored in a separate file. This is due to it being too slow and unreliable to convert coordinate to postal code
in real time. However, in order to generate the file, we first had to go through every carpark and find respective their postal code.

==== Example

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The system loads the file, `postalcodeData.txt` into a `Hashmap<Long,String>` using the `GsonUtil#loadCarparkPostalCode()` where the key is a hash and the value is a postal code.

Step 3. The system goes through every car park's coordinates and hashes them together with `GsonUtil#fnvHash(x,y)` where x is the x coordinate of the carpark and y is the y coordinate of the carpark.

Step 4. If the key is found, it will return the value which is the postal code of the car park. If not, it will return the
default value `000000`.

[NOTE]
As certain car park do not have postal code, `000000` is the default value and a flag to show that the car park does *not* have a postal code.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Source of postal code information
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Pull data from file
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Fast and efficient. No need to change due to no postal code changes.
|Cons| Unable to update for new car parks. Require you to download the .jar file again.
|===

* **Alternative 2:** Pull data from API
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Easy to update and scalable to new car parks.
|Cons| Too slow to do in real time. Takes roughly 20 minutes to update all car park postal code. Not realistic and efficient to do in real time.
|===

// end::postalcode[]

// tag::ui[]
[[Implementation-UI]]
=== UI
The UI was a combination of JavaFX, HTML and CSS. This section describes the challenges faced, how it was overcome
and an example of how it works.

==== Overview
As we wanted to showcase real time updates when the user issues a command, we had to update the HTML accordingly.
However, we did not want to just update it. We wanted to showcase the selected car park or the filtered list accordingly.

==== Example
Step 1. The user launches the application and is greeted by this UI

.On start of the application
image::UIstep3.png[width="700", align="left"]

Step 2. The user selects a car park with a `select` command. E.g. `select 10`.

.An example outcome of the `select 10` command
image::UIstep2.png[width="700", align="left"]

`SelectCommand#Execute` is called. If the input is valid, it creates a `JumpToListRequestEvent` event for `BrowserPanel#handleCarparkPanelSelectionChangedEvent()` to catch.

Step 3. The user then list all the car park with a `list` command.
A `ListCarparkRequestEvent` is created and `BrowserPanel` catches the event to call `BrowserPanel#handleListCarparkRequestEvent()`

.An example outcome of the `select 10` command
image::UIstep1.png[width="700", align="left"]

The HTML is refreshed to show all car parks.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: HTML/CSS/JS design choices
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Have a callback function in javascript
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Easy to implement google maps and stylesheet.
|Cons| Hard to test. Different rendering between devices.
|===

* **Alternative 2:** Have a query in the url parameters to filter data and update iFrame
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| No rendering issue. Easy to test and debug.
|Cons| Complex query and hard to understand again once working. Server must allow filtering by url paramters.

=== [Proposed] Weather Forecast

_This feature is coming in v2.0._
// end::weather[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

The car park data and user data will be encrypted to prevent users from editing and manipulating them.

==== Overview

The data encryption mechanism works by encrypting the information by a unique key generated by every users individual system.
The key will stored in a secured location to prevent people from accessing it.

The two main files it will encrypt are:

* Car park information
* User's favorites

==== Example

_This feature is coming in v2.0._

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

Testing is done to verify the application is running in its intended behavior. This section covers multiple ways to run test using Gradle, Gradle (Headless) and Intellij JUnit.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.parking.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.parking.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.parking.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.parking.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

Dev Ops ensure the product runs on both Linux and Windows by building it and testing after it is uploaded to Github.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Car Park Finder depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
