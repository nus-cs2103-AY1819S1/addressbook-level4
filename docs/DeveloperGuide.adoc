By: `Team W13-1`      Since: `Sep 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::byNameCommands[]
=== By-Name-Commands Feature
==== General Current Implementation

The "by-name-commands" are extensions to the regular Commands, facilitated by classes that extend the regular `Command` classes. Currently implemented are the `EditByNameCommand` and the `DeleteByNameCommand`.
They make use of `String` identifiers and the `PersonFinderUtil` to find the `Person` that the `Command` refers to, rather than an `Index`. +
This allows time to be saved when trying to run a command, because instead of having to run a `find` or `list` command to display a `Person`, then type the command based on the `Index` of the list that the `Person` appears under, commands can be targeted swiftly and precisely.
The "by-name-commands" depend on the following operation/classes:

* `PersonFinderUtil#findPerson(Model model, String personIdentifier)` -- Finds and returns the person that is uniquely identified by the `personIdentifier` in the `Model` provided.
* `NameContainsAllKeywordsPredicate` -- Tests as true when a person's name matches all the keywords in the command's arguments.
** The `PersonFinderUtil#findPerson` method makes use of the `NameContainsAllKeywordsPredicate`, which is in contrast to the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` used in the `FindCommand`.
** When editing by name, we need a more specific filter, rather than a general one. Instead of finding a Person that contains at least one identifier term in their name, the Person found must contain *all* identifier terms in their name.

Note: in the following section, the shorthand format `\_ByNameCommand` and `_Command` when used in the same context will refer to a similar type of command, e.g. `DeleteByNameCommand` and `DeleteCommand`, but `_` is general to refer to either `Delete` or `Edit`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Whether a `_ByNameCommand` should Extend the Regular `_Command`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** It extends the `Command`.
** Pros: Due to polymorphism, a `_ByNameCommand` can replace instances of `_Command` seamlessly in the code without having to
change many parts to add this additional feature. It also makes sense, because a `_ByNameCommand` "is a" `_Command` (e.g. an `EditByNameCommand` is an `EditCommand`)
** Cons: There is an unused field in `EditCommand` (`index`).
* **Alternative 2:** Create a new `_ByNameCommand`, standalone from the `_Command`
** Pros: Can save a bit of memory space on execution, since parts of the `_Command` that are not used do not provide extra baggage to the `_ByNameCommand` (e.g. no extra `Index` in the `EditByNameCommand`)
** Cons: There is a need to modify more parts of the Logic component in the code base to accommodate a new command.

===== Aspect: When the Person is Searched/Matched
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** During the execution of `execute`
** Additional details: A `String personIdentifier` will be stored in the command, and upon `execute`, a person is first matched, then the edit is carried out.
** Pros: Execute takes in the model as an argument, making searching for a Person convenient.
** Cons: The same `_ByNameCommand` executed at a different time can have a different result since it does not have a unique Person, but an identifier to find a name.
* **Alternative 2:** Before creation of the command
** Additional details: The command will have a `Person`
** Pros: The command is deterministic, since it targets a unique Person.
** Cons: Need to gain access to the model before the person can be found, which is not usually done by `AddressBookParser`; high level changes are necessary.

// tag::editByName[]
==== Edit By Name feature
===== Current Implementation

The edit by name mechanism is facilitated by the new `Command`, `EditByNameCommand`.
It extends `EditCommand` with a "Person Identifier" String that is used in place of the Index (of a displayed list) used in the normal `EditCommand`.
Additionally, it implements/depends on the following operations:

* `EditByNameCommand#execute()` -- Executes the command encapsulated by this `EditByNameCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Edit-By-Name mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and already has at least one client's contact in InsuRen.

image::EditByNameCommand1StateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `edit Alice p/91232233` to edit Alice's phone number. However, there are more than two people with a name that matches Alice, so InsuRen notifies the user.

image::EditByNameCommand2StateDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution due to multiple or no people matching the identifier, it will not edit any contact details.

Step 3. The user uses a much more specific name identifier, `edit Alice Tay Ren Ying p/91232233`, but this does not match any contact, so InsuRen notifies the user.

image::EditByNameCommand3StateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 4. The user uses a name identifier that uniquely identifies one person, `edit Alice Tay p/91232233`. The edit command is carried out, and the contact details of the identified person are changed accordingly.

image::EditByNameCommand4StateDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `EditByNameCommand`:

image::EditByNameCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="500"]
// end::editByName[]
// tag::deleteByName[]
==== Delete By Name feature
===== Current Implementation

The delete by name mechanism is facilitated by the new `Command`, `DeleteByNameCommand`.
It extends `DeleteCommand` with a "Person Identifier" String that is used in place of the Index (of a displayed list) used in the normal `DeleteCommand`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `DeleteByNameCommand#execute()` -- Executes the command encapsulated by this `DeleteByNameCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Delete-By-Name mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and already has at least one client's contact in InsuRen.

image::DeleteByNameCommand1StateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete Alice` to delete Alice from InsuRen. However, there are more than two people with a name that matches Alice, so InsuRen notifies the user.

image::DeleteByNameCommand2StateDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution due to multiple or no people matching the identifier, it will not delete any contact details.

Step 3. The user uses a much more specific name identifier, `delete Alice Tay Ren Ying`, but this does not match any contact, so InsuRen notifies the user.

image::DeleteByNameCommand3StateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 4. The user uses a name identifier that uniquely identifies one person, `delete Alice Tay`. The delete command is carried out, Alice Tay is removed from InsuRen's contact list.

image::DeleteByNameCommand4StateDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `DeleteByNameCommand`:

image::DeleteByNameCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="500"]
// end::deleteByName[]
// end::byNameCommands[]



// tag::schedule[]
=== Schedule feature
==== Current Implementation
The schedule mechanism is facilitated by the new `Command`, `Schedule`. It extends `AddressBook` with a list of meetings, stored internally as a `UniqueMeetingList`. It also allows meetings to be associated to InsuRen entries, since each `Person` can have up to one `Meeting`.
The complete list of meetings, as well as the meetings scheduled on a single day, can subsequently be accessed using the `Meetings` command.
Additionally, the `Schedule` Command implements the following operations:

* `ScheduleCommand#createScheduledPerson(Person personToSchedule, Meeting meeting)` - Returns a `Person` object that has a meeting scheduled according to `meeting`.
* `ScheduleCommand#execute()` - Executes the command encapsulated by `ScheduleCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Schedule mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and already has at least one client's contact in InsuRen.

image::ScheduleCommand1StateDiagram.png[width="300"]

Step 2. The user executes `schedule 1 m/16/10/18 1800` to schedule a meeting with the person in the first index at 1800 hours on 16th October, 2018. However, there is already a meeting scheduled at this time, so it is flagged out to the user.
[NOTE]
No meetings are scheduled if there is a clash

image::ScheduleCommand2StateDiagram.png[width="300"]

Step 3. The user executes `schedule 1 m/32/10/18 1830` but since this is not a valid date, InsuRen flags it out to the user.

image::ScheduleCommand3StateDiagram.png[width="700"]

Step 4. The user executes `schedule 1 m/16/10/18 1830`. The meeting is schedule and the person card is changed to reflect the same accordingly.

image::ScheduleCommand4StateDiagram.png[width="300"]

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the `ScheduleCommand`:

image::ScheduleCommand5StateDiagram.png[width="400"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Where meetings are stored

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** The meetings are stored in both the `Person` model and in the global meeting list `UniqueMeetingList`.
** Pros: Easy to ensure no clashes occur between meetings.
** Cons: Significant changes need to be made to the model to accomodate this.

* **Alternative 2: ** The meetings are stored in only the `Person` model.
** Pros: Minimal changes to the model required; prevents duplication of data.
** Cons: Difficult to ensure uniqueness of meeting times.

* **Alternative 3: ** The meetings are stored in only the `UniqueMeetingList`.
** Pros: Prevents the duplication of data; easy to ensure no clashes.
** Cons: Would need additional data structures to pair the meeting to the entry.

===== Aspect: Date storage format

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** The date and time is stored as a 10-character string.
** Pros: Allows the setting of a `none` value, and offers flexibility.
** Cons: Does not utilize the Java API libraries for dates and times.

* **Alternative 2:** The date and time is stored as a `DateAndTime` object.
** Pros: Ability to use Java API functions for dates.
** Cons: Less flexible as all dates entered must be valid.
// end::schedule[]


// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]
// tag::undoredo[]

=== Import feature
==== Current Implementation
The import contacts feature is facilitated by the new `Command`, `import`. It adds a list of contacts from a properly formatted csv file
to `AddressBook`. The rules pertaining to accepted formatting of csv files can be found in the user guide. Additionally, it
implements the following operations:

* `getFileFromUserInput(String)` -- gets a File from the path indicated by a user's text input.
* `getFileFromFileBrowser()` -- gets a File via a file browser.
* `parseFile(File) and parseLinesFromFile(BufferedReader)` -- parses the file from either of the above two methods. Prepares an
arrayList of Persons to add to the contact list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the import mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches an application and there is either a list of existing contacts or the list is empty.

Step 2. The user executes import command (i for shorthand). If the user ONLY types import, a file browser wlil pop up.
If the user includes a file path, InsuRen will attempt to retrieve the file from the given path.

image::import.png[width="800"]

image::import_user_input.png[width="800"]

Step 3. If no such file exists, InsuRen will report an error.

image::import_user_input_fail.png[width="800"]

Step 4. If the file is successfully loaded (regardless of method), InsuRen checks for duplicates and incomplete contacts.
Insuren compiles a list of contacts and runs the `add` Command on all of them, adding them to the list of existing contacts.

Step 5. A relevant message will be displayed, depending on whether there were successful imports, duplicate contacts etc.

image::import_success.png[width="800"]

image::import_duplicates.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `Import` Command:

image::importActivityDiagram.png[width="400"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How import executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Build from `Add` command:
Import makes use of the `hasPerson` method of `Model` to check for duplicate contacts in the csv file being imported.
It also manually checks if any entry in the csv file is incomplete in that it has no name value.
Lastly, the import command also utilizes the format checking methods in `Name`, `Email`, `Address` etc. to catch any
entries with invalid formats
** Pros: Easy to implement, any future modifications to Add or any changes to the validity of `Name`, `Email` etc will
not cause import to crash.
** Cons: Higher coupling.

=== Export feature
==== Current Implementation
The export contacts feature is facilitated by the new `Command`, `export`. It takes the current list of contacts in InsuRen
and exports it as a csv file, whose file name is given by the user and MUST end with .csv. The exported contact list will be
saved in the root directory of the project. `export` implements the following operations:

* `parse(String)` - parses the user's given file name String and checks if it is valid.
* `populateFile(PrintWriter, Model)` - populates the (already initialized) file with data from the current Model.
* `insertPersonIntoCsv(Person, PrintWriter) and cleanEntry(String)` - these two methods add contacts to the csv in the same
order as they are displayed in InsuRen. Fields are cleaned by removing commas and brackets before being inserted in to the csv.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the export mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches an application and there is either a list of existing contacts or the list is empty.

Step 2. The user executes export command (x for shorthand), followed by FILE_NAME. If no file name is given or the file name
does not end with .csv, InsuRen throws an error message.

Step 3. InsuRen fetches the current contact list, creates a new .csv file and copies all contacts into it.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `Export` Command:

image::ExportActivityDiagram.png[width="400"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How export executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Read contacts from a ReadOnlyAddressBook:
Export makes use of model.getAddressBook() and the getPersonList method within.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Since we are only dealing with a ReadOnlyAddressBook, the state of InsuRen will not be altered.
** Cons: Only able to capture snapshots of the contact list. Not dynamically updated.

// tag::addpicture[]
=== Add Picture feature
==== Current Implementation

The picture mechanism is facilitated by the new `PictureCommand`.
It extends `Command` with an execution to set a picture, stored internally in `Person` as `picture`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the picture mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and already has at least one client's contact in InsuRen.

image::PictureCommand1StateDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `pic 4 l/images/invalidpath.jpg` to add a picture for David. However, the file `invalidpath.jpg` does not exist.
`Picture#isValidPicture()` validates the given file path and InsuRen informs the user that the path given is invalid.

image::PictureCommand2StateDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not pass the validation check, `Picture#isValidPicture()`, so InsuRen will not update the user's picture and instead return an error message.

Step 3. The user now decides to execute `pic 4 l/images/david.jpg`, a valid image located in his drive, to add a picture for David.
The `pic` command calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to retrieve the list of contacts and filters `index` 4.
The `PictureCommandParser` retrieves the input from the user and validates it.
`ParserUtil#parseFileLocation()` is called and the picture path is checked. If the path is valid, it then calls `Picture#setPicture()` to update the picture for the contact. Finally, `Model#commitAddressBook()` is called, causing the modified state of the address book after the `pic 4 l/images/david.jpg` command executes to be saved.

image::PictureCommand3StateDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `PictureCommand`:

image::PictureCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="500"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How picture is stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Person` has a picture field.
** Pros: `Picture` can have it's own `Picture#isValidPicture()` method to validate the input. It is consistent with the other fields within `Person`.
** Cons: More memory is used as there is a need to store an object. A new `Picture` class has to be made and implemented.
* **Alternative 2:** `Person` will store a `Path` or `String` instead.
** Pros: Will use less memory (do not have to implement a new class and store an object).
** Cons: All checks have to be done within the `execute` method. Might overlook certain details and cause bugs.

===== Aspect: Type of picture

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Picture can be a `.jpg` or `.png` file.
** Pros: `.jpg` and `.png` are common file formats that the user is used to.
** Cons: Not flexible in what image files are accepted.
* **Alternative 2:** In addition to alternative 1, the picture can also be a valid `URL` containing an image.
** Pros: More flexible. User does not have to download the image file onto his local disk in order to use it. Can retrieve pictures of his contacts online and use it directly.
** Cons: Additional checks have to be done (i.e. check if the `URL` is valid, check if the `URL` is an image file, what happens if the `URL` or server is broken?)

===== Aspect: Path validation

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** File location input from user is checked against a regular expression and `Files#exists()`.
** Pros: More secure. `Files#exists()` checks whether the file is on the disk while the regular expression checks for any ill-intended input as well as the file extension.
** Cons: Will have to check twice.
* **Alternative 2:** Just do `Files#exists()`.
** Pros: Straightforward and simple.
** Cons: Less secure, might result in an error if the file is not checked properly.

// end::addpicture[]

// tag::tagcommand[]
=== Tag feature
==== Current Implementation

Each contact in Insuren can have any number of tags. The `tag` command allows the user to easily find contacts by tags.
The user can also easily edit or delete tags using the tag command, allowing for better management of tags in Insuren.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tag command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and already has a few tagged contacts in InsuRen.

image::TagCommand1StateDiagram.png[width="300"]

Step 2. The user executes `tag Important` to retrieve all contacts tagged with `Important`. Tags are **case-sensitive**.

image::TagCommand2StateDiagram.png[width="300"]

Step 3. The user executes `tag Family Colleague` to retrieve all contacts tagged with `Family` or `Colleague`.

image::TagCommand3StateDiagram.png[width="300"]

Step 4. If the user wants to change all instances of the `Colleague` tag to `Work`, the user can input `tag edit
Colleague Work`. `edit` is **not** case-sensitive.

image::TagCommand4StateDiagram.png[width="300"]

Step 5. If the user would like to delete the `close` tag, the user simply executes `tag close delete`.
`delete` is **not** case-sensitive.

image::TagCommand5StateDiagram.png[width="300"]

Step 6. If the user would like to delete the `Family` and `Colleague` tags together, the user simply executes `tag
Family Colleague delete`. Both tags will be deleted.

image::TagCommand6StateDiagram.png[width="300"]

All tag commands can be undone or redone with `undo` or `redo` respectively. +
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `PictureCommand`:

image::TagCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="500"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How tag command works

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Search through the address book's list of persons to find all persons with any matching tag.
** Pros: Consistent with `find` command, easy to implement.
** Cons: Performance can be slow especially if InsuRen has many contacts as InsuRen will look through every person.
* **Alternative 2:** A hashmap is used with the key values being each unique tag and the values being a list of persons associated with each tag.
** Pros: Will have faster lookup, O(1) access time to get the list of persons associated with a tag.
** Cons: Will use more memory storing a separate data structure. This separate data structure also has to be updated with the right list of persons
every time a person's details are edited or a person is deleted. Programming such a data structure would require significantly more effort.

// end::tagcommand[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

Due to the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), any disclosure of the user's personal information is considered to have severe implications.
Thus, all data that are being stored in `Storage` should be encrypted using a secure encryption scheme with a secret key.
When the user opens InsuRen, he should be prompted to login before he is able to access the secure data.

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, InsuRen depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your InsuRen application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
+

image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
+
**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
+
****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-result-after.png[width="200"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

**After**
+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]
+
****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
