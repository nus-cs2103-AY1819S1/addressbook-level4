By: `T13-4`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `10`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)to add  manually
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design
tag::architecture[]
[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="600"]
image::[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -t CS2103 -e 4 -z 2`.

.Component interactions for `delete -t CS2103 -e 4 -z 2` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteModule.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TranscriptChangedEvent` when the Transcript data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the panels of the UI being updated to reflect the latest modules in the system.

.Component interactions for `delete -t CS2103 -e 4 -z 2` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteModuleEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.
end::architecture[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel`, 'ModuleListPanel' etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component uses JavaFX UI 'DarkTheme' to draw different text, sizes, fonts, and colours from. The actual data displayed in the UI is called using a sample transcript which is created through the Module and Transcript classes. The values themselves are abstracted from the '.fxml' files so the UI display can be easily updated.

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Layout]]
=== UI component
* The bottom two thirds of the UI is seperated into 2 panels to clearly identify the different outputs from commands entered by the user.
* The first panel on the left is for Modules that have already been completed; this is shown by the GREEN circles which
surround the grades which indicate this grade is "set" and of no concern to the user anymore.
* The second panel on the right is for Modules that have not yet been completed by the user; this is shown by the RED
circles which surround the grades to indicate that this is a grade the user should be aware of. The red indicates an
urgency towards that module as it's outcome will affect the users predicted CAP goal.
* The top third of the UI is seperated into four distinct rows;
.  The first row contains the title and drop down menu's for `File` and `Help` options.
.  The second row is the command line and how the user interacts with the application. Notice there is no button for the
user to click when they are ready to enter their command; it is expected the user is familiar with Command Line Interface
and will know to use the `enter` button on their keyboard when ready to submit a command to the app.
.  The third row is where replies from the application to the user will be displayed. When the commands become too big
for the box, a scroll down option becomes available for the user to continue reading the message.
.  The fourth row displays the summary of the users current CAP goal and their target CAP.

//tag::designlogic[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TranscriptParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the +
 `execute("delete -t CS1231")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -t CS1231` Command
image::DeleteModuleForLogic.png[width="800"]
//end::designlogic[]

[[Design-Model]]
//tag::designmodel[]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram_Transcript.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Transcript data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
* provides filter function to filter `Module` with different kind of `Grade`

//end::designmodel[]
//tag::designstorage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` interface defines a component which

* can save `UserPref` objects in JSON format and read it back.
* can save Transcript data in JSON format and read it back.

The `StorageManager` implements the `Storage` interface, and updates the transcript JSON file when the `TranscriptChangedEvent` is fired (see Figure 4). It also logs the reading and saving of transcript data.

//end::designstorage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::captargetcalculation[]
=== CAP & Target Grades Calculation

The two calculations are triggered upon an change to the list of modules in `Transcript` _i.e. add/update/delete_.

.Sequence Diagram of updating modules in Transcript
image::SDTranscriptModulesUpdate.png[width="800"]

[[Implementation-CAP]]
==== CAP Calculation

The CAP calculation is handled by `Transcript`.

The pseudo-code for CAP is the following:
```
all_points <- sum(credits(m) * points(m) for all completed modules m)
all_credits <- sum(credits(m) for all completed modules m)

CAP <- all_points/all_credits
```

.Sequence Diagram of CAP calculation
image::SDTranscriptCalculateCap.png[width="800"]

CAP Calculation is triggered by:

[[Implementation-TargetGrades]]
==== Target Grades Calculation

The target `Grade` calculation is facilitated by `Transcript`.
The returned list of modules with target `Grade` assures the following properties:

* Reducing the `Grade` of any proposed target will result in the increase of another.
* If `x` is the minimum `Grade` required when assigned to *all* modules to obtain the desired CAP Goal,
none of the proposed target `Grade` will be greater than `x`
+
i.e. if assigning `B+` to *all* module is the minimal requirement to obtain the desired CAP Goal,
none of the proposed target `Grade` will be `A-` or above.

Below is the pseudo-code for Target Grade Calculation:
```
CG <- CAP goal of user.
TC <- total credit of completed and incomplete modules.
PO <- total points achieved from completed and adjusted modules.
P <- CG * TC - PO // total points needed to achieve from incomplete modules.

mc_remaining <- sum of module credit of all incomplete modules
accumulated_points <- 0
for every incomplete Module m:
    avg_point_per_mc <- (P - accumulated_points) / mc_remaining
    target(m) <- ceiling(avg_point_per_mc)
    mc_remaining <- mc_remaining - credits(m)
    accumulated_points <- accumulated_points + (credits(m) * target(m))

```

This sequence diagram shows the interaction of the different classes involved
in the process of creating a new Module with updated target grade

And below the activity diagram to further illustrate several exceptional cases.

// end::captargetcalculation[]

//tag::transcriptstorageimplementation[]
=== Transcript Storage: Reading and Writing
Whenever the in-memory `Transcript` object is changed, the transcript data file is updated. When the app initializes, it will look for an existing data file from which to load the transcript.+
If the file is not found, the app will initialize with an empty Transcript.+
If the file is found but the data is an incorrect format or there is some problem reading from the file, the app will initialize with an empty Transcript as well.+

When the app initializes, it looks for the file name provided by `data/preferences.json` under the `transcriptFilePath` key - by default this is `data/transcript_demo.json`. This file stores all transcript data including modules data and cap Goal information, such as its value, whether it is set, and whether it is impossible. The `transcriptFilePath` may be changed manually by the user.+

By using the `Jackson` library to store the Transcript data as a JSON file instead of an XML file, we avoid having to write `XMLSerializableTranscript` and `XMLAdaptedModule` classes. Instead, we simply register a custom `JSONTranscriptDeserializer` on the `ReadOnlyTranscript` class so that when we read from the JSON file, Jackson's `ObjectMapper` is able to use the values to reconstruct the saved object.
//end::transcriptstorageimplementation[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

//tag::targetUser[]
[appendix]
== Target User Profile
- An NUS Student who has a need to keep track of current CAP, calculate expected CAP, and grades required to achieve desired CAP.
- Prefer desktop apps over other types.
- Can type fast.
- Prefers typing over mouse input.
- Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps.

== Value Proposition
Helps students manage their CAP and predict what grades they need to reach their CAP goal.
//end::value[]

//tag::userStories[]
[appendix]
== User Stories

*Must-Have*

1.  As a user, I can add all the modules I have taken (module code,
*module title*, MCs, grade, semester taken) so that I can calculate
average mark I need to graduate with desired CAP.
2.  As a user I can delete modules so if I change my mind or fail a
module I can re-calculate my average.
3.  As a user I can delete modules so that if i entered a wrong module
or failed it, I can remove it.
4.  As a user I can edit the marks I’ve entered previously so that I can
update my CAP.
5.  As a user, I can enter a CAP goal so that I can keep track of the
progress of my course
6.  As a user, I can calculate the average mark I need across the
modules I’ve entered so I can see what mark I need for each module to
achieve my CAP goal. +
7.  As a user, I can enter in predicted grades for modules so I can see
what CAP I would get if I got these grades in my modules.
8.  As a user, I can close the app and return to modify my entries so I
can enter my entries incrementally.

*Nice-To-Have*

1. As a user, I can add a module without having to add the code, MCs, or semester taken so that I can quickly calculate CAP without worrying about the modules.
2. As a user, I can still enter the same modules but get warned first so that I would not mistakenly enter the same module again
3. As a user, I can import all modules for this semester with NUSMods link so that my data can be consistent with NUSMods.
4. As a user I can search for a module via keyword or module title, and select it for entering my grade so that I don’t have to remember the module code.
5. As a user, I can adjust what marks I need for each module to achieve my CAP so I can put more emphasis on certain modules instead of expecting the same grade across all modules.
6. As a user, I can view my current semester’s module goals and use a GUI to adjust projected grade for each module, and other modules will automatically adjust to compensate, so that I can see easily modify my data to see what grades I need for other modules.
7. As a user, I can view total current MCs so that i can check if I meet the number of mc I need to graduate
8. As a user I can see if my CAP Goal is possible so I can check whether it is achievable.
9. As a user, I can list modules taken by level as an alternative listing mode, so that it is easier to track graduation requirements.
10. As a user, I can see what the highest possible CAP I can achieve with my current grades is so that I can set an appropriate goal.
11. As a user, I can see what the minimum grades I need per module is to pass the year with my current grades so that I can see what the minimum about of work I need to do is.


*Not-Useful*

1. As a user, I can view the module descriptions so that I know what modules I should take
2. As a user I can enter the MCs for exchange I can keep track of modules that may not be mapped to our database of modules codes or isn’t the default number of MCs.
3. As a user, I can export my timetable so that I can share it with my friend.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

//tag::manualteststorage[]

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

. Saving transcript data

.. Add some modules, set a CAP goal, and close the app.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The added modules and CAP goal are retained.

. Changing the transcript data file path
.. Add some modules, set a CAP goal, and close the app.
.. Change the value of `transcriptFilePath` in the file `data/preferences.json` (found in the same directory as the jar file) to some non-existent file such as `data/transcript_test.json`.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.+
   Expected: The app will initialize with an empty transcript (no modules or CAP goal). On further change, the app will save the transcript data to the new file `data/transcript_test..json`.

. Importing transcript data
.. Add some modules, set a CAP goal, and close the app.
.. Save another copy of the jar file in another directory and open and close this second app.
.. Replace the `data/transcript.json` of the second app with the `data/transcript.json` from the first app.
.. Relaunch the new app. +
   Expected: The app will initialize with the added modules and CAP goal from the first app.+

=== Target Grade Calculation

[NOTE]
_To follow this guide, ensure the there are only the following 2 modules:_ +
Completed Modules:
CS1010 year 1 sem 1 credits 4 grade B+ +
   `add -m cs1010 -y 1 -s 1 -c 4 -g B+` +
CS1020 year 2 sem 1 credits 4 grade C+ +
   `add -m cs2010 -y 2 -s 1 -c 4 -g C+`

[NOTE]
You can also further verify that the given target grades together with the adjusted grades
and completed grades indeed provide a CAP greater to or equal to your CAP Goal if it is possible
with link:https://gradecalc.info/sg/nus/cumulative_gpa_calc.pl[This URL]
