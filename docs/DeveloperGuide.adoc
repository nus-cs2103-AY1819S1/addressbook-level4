By: `T12-2`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819-T12-2/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `AddressBookModel` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `AddressBookModel` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI comprises two main interfaces:

* MainWindow: Supports patient information management
* ScheduleMainWindow: Supports appointment management

`MainWindow` is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel`
 etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

`ScheduleMainWindow` consists of parts as well, including its own copy of `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
and a `ScheduleListPanel`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are
 in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
 link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
 link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in a `Model` (Either `AddressBookModel` or `ScheduleModel`) so that the UI can auto-update
when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.


[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/addressBookModel/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP addressBookModel, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a addressBookModel may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== On-the-fly Switching between Modes

==== Current Implementation

This feature enables the software to separate patient information from appointment information clearly. The two modes
are `patient management mode` and `appointment management mode`. Users can switch between one mode to the other mode using
`mode command`. In addition, the feature supports auto-switch function. In other words, when user type in a valid command
(add, delete, select, find or edit) to manipulate appointments in patient mode, the software will switch to appointment
mode automatically, and vice versa.

The switching feature is mainly implemented using the eventbus and subscriber approach. The main logic of the switch is
implemented inside the UiManager class.The UiManager class maintains an instance of each patient mode window and appointment
mode window and each has an unique stage. When the software is initialised, both windows are initialised, but only the
patient window is shown as it is the default mode.

There are three steps involved in the processing of the switch feature:

Step 1. Event Post: When user types in a `mode command`,the ModeCommand will post a switchToPatientEvent or
SwitchToAppointmentEvent to the event center.

.Mode Command Code Snippet
[source,java]
----
 @Override
    public CommandResult execute(AddressBookModel addressBookModel, ScheduleModel scheduleModel,
                                 DiagnosisModel diagnosisModel, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(addressBookModel);
        requireNonNull(scheduleModel);
        if (this.cmdType.equals(CMDTYPE_PATIENT)) {
            EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new SwitchToPatientEvent());
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_PATIENT_SWITCH_SUCCESS);
        } else if (this.cmdType.equals(CMDTYPE_APPOINTMENT)) {
            EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new SwitchToAppointmentEvent());
            return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SCHEDULE_SWITCH_SUCCESS);
        } else {
            throw new CommandException("Unexpected command type: should have been caught in ModeCommandParser.");
        }
    }
----

Step 2. Event Handle: UiManager is registered as an event handler. It subscribes from the events center and call
relevant method (switchToPatient or switchToAppointment).

Step 3. Switch Handle: Inside the switch methods, the current window will be hided and the other window will be shown.

.UiManager Code Snippet
[source,java]
----
 @Override
    public void switchToAppointment() {
        logger.info("Switching to Appointment Mode");
        try {
            appointmentMainWindow.show();
            appointmentMainWindow.setShowing(true);
            appointmentMainWindow.setNotePanelToDefault();
            mainWindow.hide();
            mainWindow.setShowing(false);
        } catch (Throwable e) {
            logger.severe(StringUtil.getDetails(e));
            showFatalErrorDialogAndShutdown("Fatal error during switching", e);
        }
    }
----
[NOTE]
The implementation allows the window to know whether it is at the showing state. This is mainly to solve the problem
that help window is initialised from both windows when `help command` is called. Hence, when switch methods are called,
the showing state of the windows should also be updated. In addition, the feature that each window knows its showing
state is also helpful for future refinements.

The auto-switch feature is implemented using similar approach. When a valid command is executed, a event is posted to the
event center to switch to the corresponding mode. The way switch method is implemented allows the current showing window
not to be checked. For now, when user switch from patient mode to patient mode, the method will still be called but
it does not reflect any change in the UI. One way to refine is to allow software to check the current showing state and
if user switch from one mode to the same mode, an exception will be thrown. This implementation is, however, not very necessary.

image::mode_command_sequence.PNG[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Switching mode or switching panel
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Having an entire set of UI, in this case `Appointment Main Window`to hold the
appointment related data.
** Pros: It is more flexible for future change. It would be easier to add more modes in the future if needed.
The design of the UI for various modes can be modified because they are independent from one another.
** Cons: It is more difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 2 :** Only adding in an appointment panel and switching the panel if necessary.
** Pros:It is easier to implement.
** Cons: The program would be constrained if more modes are to be added in the future.

===== Aspect: Execution of mode command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Posting the switch mode event regardless of the current mode that user is in.
** Pros: The logic do not have to be aware of the UI component and hence reduce coupling.
** Cons: Users can switch from one mode to the same mode.
* **Alternative 2 :** The mode command maintains an instance of the UiManager and keep tracks of the current window
that is showing. When user requires to switch mode, identifies the current mode and generate exception if the user is
already in this mode.
** Pros: It can respond more accurately when user wish to switch mode.
** Cons: It increases dependency on the code unnecessarily.

=== Natural Language Processing for Adding an Appointment

This feature facilitates scheduling, which enables the user to add appointments into the schedule system with user input phrased in natural expressions, and does so in a conversational process enabled by several prompt windows.

==== Current Implementation

This feature currently mainly implements a `ScheduleEvent` parser which parses natural language user input, and creates the intended `ScheduleEvent` object to be stored.

There are five steps involved in the processing of this feature:

Step 1. Breaking Down: User input is broken down into sub-fields, namely, patient and time.

Step 2. Patient Parsing:  User input for patient is parsed into the corresponding `PersonId` object.

Step 3. Time Parsing:  User input for time is parsed into a `Pair<Calendar>` object.

Step 4. Further Prompting: User is prompted with two prompt windows where tags and additional notes can be added.

Step 5. Generating Appointment: The resulting `ScheduleEvent` object corresponding to all user input is created.

The following is an example of a use case, and how the mechanism behaves:

User Input: `add appointment for David Lee next week`.

Step 1. Breaking Down: The user input string, starting with `for`, is passed into a `ScheduleEventParser` object, and broken down into meaningful substrings for patient and time respectively:

.. Programme starts with assuming that the substring for identifying the patient is only one word long, and the remaining string following that one word all the way to the end of the string is the input for time. In this case, `David` is the assumed patient substring and `Lee next week` is the assumed time substring.
.. Programme takes the assumed time substring,`Lee next week`, and checks if it is a valid time expression.
.. As a match cannot be found, it means that the assumed demarcation between patient and time inputs is incorrect. Programme makes another attempt by assuming the patient substring is longer by one word (i.e. `David Lee`) and the time substring is shorter by one word (i.e. `next week`). It takes the new assumed time substring and checks its validity again.
.. As a match is found this time, it indicates that the assumption is correct. `David Lee` will be carried forward to the Patient Parsing step while `next week` will be carried forward to the Time Parsing step.
.. In other cases where a match cannot be found after all assumptions have been tested, an exception will be thrown indicating that the user has not used an accepted expression.

The activity diagram below illustrates this process:

.Activity Diagram to Illustrate Step 1 Breaking Down
image::breakDownInputActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. Patient Parsing: The string `David Lee` is parsed and converted into the corresponding `PersonId` object:

.. Programme uses this string as the search string to create a new `MatchPersonPredicate` object which is then used to filter the list of patients.
.. If only one patient can be matched, the `PersonId` of the patient is immediately returned.
.. If multiple patients can be matched, programme passes the list of matched patients as a `String` into a `Prompt` object, where the list is displayed to the user in a `PromptWindow`. User is expected to enter the ID of the intended patient. The `PersonID` of the final intended patient is returned.

Step 3. Time Parsing: The string `next week` is passed to a `DateTimeParser` object where it is parsed and converted into a `Pair<Calendar>` object to represent the user's chosen time slot for the appointment:

.. Programme executes a keyword search and invokes the method `getWeekDates(currentTime, 1)`, where it converts `next week` into a datetime range, by doing relevant calculations on the `Calendar` object which represents the current time. For instance, if the command is executed on 16/10/2018, `next week` becomes a datetime range from 22/10/2018 09:00 - 28/10/2018 18:00. This range takes into consideration the doctor's working hours.
.. Programme searches the list of already scheduled appointments within the time range obtained. It finds a list of available time periods by taking the complement within that range (taking into consideration the doctor's working hours), and passes the list as a `String` into a `Prompt` object, where the list is displayed to the user in a `PromptWindow`.
.. User inputs a specific time slot from the list of available time periods. For instance, user inputs `22/10/2018 09:00 - 10:00`. This string is then passed back to `DateTimeParser` and converted into a `Pair<Calendar>` object that represents this time slot, by invoking the method `parseTimeSlot(timeSlotString)`.

Step 4. Further Prompting: The user is presented with two more `PromptWindow`, where they can provide further inputs for tags and additional notes for the appointment. This is done through a simple I/O mechanism.

Step 5. Generating Appointment: Results from the previous steps are used to fill the attributes of a newly created `ScheduleEvent` object which is then returned.


The sequence diagram below summarises this feature. Note that step 4 and 5 are omitted in the diagram as they are relatively trivial:

.Sequence Diagram to Illustrate Feature
image::NaturalLanguageProcessingSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Abstraction over time slot

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `Pair<Calendar>` where the `key` and `value` represent the start time and end time of a time slot respectively.
** Pros: It is easy to implement.
** Cons: `key` and `value` are not intuitive in this context, hence it is difficult for other developers to understand.
* **Alternative 2:** Define a `Duration` class which has the `Pair<Calendar>` as an attribute, providing an additional layer of abstraction.
** Pros: It is easy for new developers to understand the context by defining methods such as `getStartTime()`, at the same time not exposing the internal implementation.
** Cons: Defining this class may be not worth the effort as it has only one use case (as an attribute in `ScheduleEvent`) in the application.

===== Aspect: Algorithm to find available time slots given a list of already scheduled appointments in an interval

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Loop through the list of appointments twice. The first time is to find available time slots in days where there are scheduled appointments. The second time is to find completely free days. The code snippets show the two loops.

    private List<Pair<Calendar>> getAvailableSlotList(List<ScheduleEvent> scheduledAppts, Pair<Calendar> dateInterval) {
        // ...
        for (int i = 0; i < scheduledAppts.size() - 1; i++) {
            // ...
            findAvailableSlotsBetweenTwoAppts(availableSlots, currentEnd, nextStart);
        }
        // ...
        findCompletelyAvailableDays(scheduledAppts, dateInterval, availableSlots);
    }

    private void findCompletelyAvailableDays(List<ScheduleEvent> scheduledAppts, Pair<Calendar> dateInterval, List<Pair<Calendar>> availableSlots) {
        // ...
        for (ScheduleEvent appt: scheduledAppts) {
            // ...
        }
        // ...
    }

** Pros: It is easy to implement.
** Cons: Performance is adversely affected because the list has to be searched through twice.
* **Alternative 2:** Keep a day pointer and loop through the list of appointments only once to find all available time slots.
** Pros: It enhances performance because the list is searched through only once.
** Cons: It is harder to implement, due to the difficulties in manipulating `java.util.Calendar` as a day pointer. Edge cases such as crossing the year boundaries are difficult to handle.

=== Diagnosis

==== Current Implementation

The diagnosis feature is facilitated by `Diagnosis` class. This class contains a private attribute called
`matcher` of type `HashMap<Disease, Set<Symptom>>`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Diagnosis#hasDisease(Disease disease)` – Check if the application contains the `disease` input by users
* `Diagnosis#getSymptoms(Disease disease)` – Return a `list` of all the related `symptoms` of a `disease` input by users
* `Diagnosis#getDiseases()` – Return a `list` of existing `diseases` from the database
* `Diagnosis#addMatcher(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms)` – Store a particular `disease` with its set of `symptoms` in database.
* `Diagnosis#predictDisease(Set<Symptom> symptoms)` – Predict a `disease` for a set of `symptoms` input by users.

These operations are exposed in the `DiagnosisModel` interface as
`DiagnosisModel# hasDisease(Disease disease)`,
`DiagnosisModel#getSymptoms(Disease disease)`, `DiagnosisModel#getDiseases()`,
`DiagnosisModel#addMatcher(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms)` and
`DiagnosisModel#predictDisease(Set<Symptom> symptoms)` respectively.

.Diagnosis Class Diagram
image::DiagnosisClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `diagnosis` mechanism behaves at each step:

.Sequence Diagram
image::DiagnosisSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `Diagnosis` will be instantiated and its
private attribute `matcher` will be initialized by calling the `static` method `Diagnosis#readDataFromCsvFile()`.

Step 2. The user executes `find disease Influenza` command to get symptoms of “Influenza” stored in the patient book.
The `find disease` command calls `DiagnosisModel#hasDisease(Disease disease)` first, if the return `Boolean` value is `false`,
the user will be notified with a `command exception` thrown . If the return value is `true`, it will continue to call
`DiagnosisModel#getSymptoms(Disease disease)` and get all the `symptoms` related to “Influenza” in a `List<Symptom>`.

Step 3. If the disease is not present in the database record, the user can execute
`add disease d/Influenza s/ncoordination s/fever s/pleuritic pain…` command to insert the data into the database record.
Now, the `add disease` command calls `DiagnosisModel#addMatcher(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms)`.
Now it will call the `static` method `writeDataFromCsvFile(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms)` which returns
a `Hashmap` of type `HashMap<Disease, Set<Symptom>>` and assigns it to `this.matcher` to update the `private` attribute.

.Add Command Code Snippet
[source,java]
----
    /**
     * Adds a disease and its related symptoms into the database
     *
     * @param disease  disease input.
     * @param symptoms related symptoms.
     */


    public void addMatcher(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms) {
        requireNonNull(disease);
        requireAllNonNull(symptoms);
        boolean hasDisease = this.hasDisease(disease);
        if (!hasDisease) {
            this.matcher = writeDataToCsvFile(disease, symptoms);
        }
    }
----

Step 4. The user executes `list disease` command to get a list of diseases stored in the patient book.
The `list disease` command calls `DiagnosisModel#getDiseases()` which returns a `list` of diseases present in the
`key set of matcher`.

Step 5. Now the user decides to execute the command `predict` to search for a `disease` in database that
matches with input symptoms. This command calls `DiasnosisModel#predictDisease(Set<Symptom>)` which returns a `list`
of diseases that are mapped to a set of symptoms containing the given set.

.Predict Command Code Snippet
[source,java]
----
    /**
     * Predicts a disease with a given set of symptoms.

    public List<Disease> predictDisease(Set<Symptom> symptoms) {
        requireAllNonNull(symptoms);
        List<Disease> diseases = this.matcher.keySet().stream()
                .filter(disease -> this.matcher.get(disease).containsAll(symptoms)).collect(Collectors.toList());
        diseases.sort(Comparator.comparing(Disease::toString));
        return diseases;
    }
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Disease-symptom matching data structures

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `HashMap` where the `key` and `value` are the disease and set of
related symptoms respectively.
** Pros: Better performance in terms of efficiency; duplicate values are also eliminated.
** Cons: Difficult for other developers to understand.
* **Alternative 2:** Define a `Match` class with two private attributes representing the disease and a set of
related symptoms, then maintain a `list` of `Match` objects.
** Pros: Easy for new developers to understand when disease-symptom pairs are encapsulated in an object.
** Cons: May take up more memory, leading to performance issues.

===== Aspect: Searching algorithm to support disease prediction operation

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `stream` to search and collect all potential diseases.
** Pros: Easy to implement and easy for new developers to understand.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of lower efficiency.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a more systematic way to determine the suitability of each disease by
calculating the similarity of its pre-existing set of symptoms and the set of symptoms given by users.
** Pros: More accurate in determining the correct diseases.
** Cons: Hard to implement and understand.

// tag::delete[]
=== Deletion of Entries from Working Dataset

==== Current Implementation

Instances of `Person` are currently being deleted via soft-delete: setting the instance variable `exists` to `false`.

Instances of `ScheduleEvent` are currently being deleted directly: removing the objects themselves altogether from the
data structure encapsulated within `Schedule`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Deletion of Person or ScheduleEvent Entries

* **Alternative 1:** Deletion is accomplished via soft-delete.
** This was chosen for deleting patients from the address book in order to ensure that a patient can never be permanently removed. Preventing deletion ensures that even deceased patients may have their information accessed, and guarantees that accidental deletion will never lead to important patient data being lost. Implementation is done via the addition of an `exists` field in the Person class.
** Using this approach for deleting appointments from the schedule will work but is unnecessary as appointment information is not nearly as sensitive as patient data.
* **Alternative 2:** Person deletion is accomplished via actual deletion from the person list.
** Patient data is no longer recoverable after deletion (unless undo/redo is implemented). This is the approach chosen for deleting appointments from the schedule instead, since this information may easily be recovered and is not nearly as sensitive as a patient's medical information.
// end::delete[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo (Coming in v2.0)

==== Proposed Implementation

Undo/Redo is accomplished using `VersionedAddressBook` and `VersionedSchedule`. This is encapsulated in the
`ApplicationDataState` class.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect : How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book and schedule.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person or event being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book and schedule states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update `HistoryManager`, `VersionedSchedule` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Drug Database Search

This feature allows the user to view pharmacological information about medical drugs currently licensed for sale
in Singapore.

==== Current Implementation

The execution of a drug database search via the `find drug` command takes place in the following manner:

. The user enters the command `find drug [drugname]`, which is parsed by `FindCommandParser`
to ensure that it has a single argument only - `[drugname]` - and that the argument contains
only uppercase and lowercase alphabets.

. If errors are found in the input, a `ParseException` is thrown and the user sees an error message
containing the proper command syntax.
If the input is valid, a `FindCommand` is generated with a trimmed, lowercase version of
`[drugname]` as its search string,
and `DRUG` as its command type.

. `FindCommand` is executed through its `execute()` method, and
calls the static `DrugSearch.find()` method with the search string as an argument.

. The `DrugSearch.find()` method ensures that the search string does _not_ match any of a
list of generic words like "syrup" or "tablet" which are not suitable search phrases,
as they would generate hundreds of results. If the check fails, a specific error string
is returned, whereupon the `FindCommand` object throws a command exception, notifying the user
that their search string is too generic.

. If the check passes, the `DrugSearch.find()` method creates a `DrugCsvUtil` object as a local
variable, passing in the search string as an input to its constructor. The `DrugCsvUtil` object now corresponds
to that search string only.

. The `DrugCsvUtil` contains a `nextMatchingResult` method which reads a static drug database stored in "datasetForDrugs.csv" (formatted in UTF-8)
from top to bottom, and each time it is called, it returns the _next_ matching result from
the database in the form of a `String[]`. Once there are no matching results, it begins to return
`null`.

. The DrugSearch.find() method adds the matching results returned by the `DrugCsvUtil` to a static
cache, one after the other. Once it receives `null` as a return value,
it formats just the _Name, Classification and Active Ingredient(s)_ of the drug results in the cache
into a `String` of search results and returns it to `FindCommand`, which
displays them. The full information can be displayed using the `moreinfo` command (discussed later).
If the cache is empty (i.e. there were no matches in the database), `DrugSearch.find()` returns a specific error String instead,
whereupon `FindCommand` throws a `CommandException`, and the user sees an error message
indicating that no results were found.

. The cache is _not_ cleared at the end of the search: instead, it is cleared when a _new_search
is initiated, in order to accommodate the `moreinfo` command.

. When the results are displayed to the user in the form of a numbered list, they have the option
of entering the command `moreinfo [RESULTNO]` to view more information about any of the results.

. The argument of the command is parsed by `MoreInfoCommandParser` to ensure that it is numeric,
not less than or equal to zero, and is less than 10,000.
If the parse fails, a `ParseException` is thrown and the user sees the
error message that corresponds to the problem with their input.

. If the parse is successful, a `MoreInfoCommand` object is created, which executes through its
`execute()` method, and calls `DrugSearch.moreInfo()` with the index number as its argument.

. `DrugSearch.moreInfo()` checks that the index is in the cache of results from the most recent
search. If the cache is empty, this means that the user has not carried out a single drug
search yet, or that the most recent drug search turned up no results. In these cases,
a specific error string is returned, and `MoreInfoCommand` throws a `CommandException`, and
the user sees the appropriate error message.

. If the index is contained in the cache, the full information about the corresponding drug
(seven categories of information) is formatted into a `String` result and returned, which
is then displayed.

_Note_: The drug database is updated as of September, 2018.

The feature has been implemented using the OpenCSV library, which offers tools for manipulating
.csv (Comma Separated Values) files.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect : How to format search results

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displays only partial information about each drug in the
initial search results.
** Pros: Prevents search results from being several pages long, and verbose.
** Cons: Requires a separate command to be implemented for full information about
any particular result to be displayed
* **Alternative 2:** Display all seven categories of information about each drug in the initial
results.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Results will be very long, and contain information that the user may not actually need.

===== Aspect : How to read the drug database

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a separate I/O utility class (`DrugCsvUtil`) to read
directly from the file each time a search is carried out
** Pros: Runs fast, and is modular.
** Cons: Filepath-related code can break if the working directory changes upon packaging into jar.
* **Alternative 2:** Read contents of file onto memory in the form of a `HashMap<>`
** Pros: File only has to be read once, and the contents can be easy manipulated since they
are in the form of mapped pairs stored as a class variable.
** Cons: Causes the program to become very slow, as 2MB of data must be read into memory.

===== Aspect : How `moreinfo` works

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `moreinfo` can be used repeatedly, but only on one result
at a time.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May cause user to have to recall a long list of index numbers if they want to
see more information about multiple results.
* **Alternative 2:** `moreinfo` accepts multiple indices in a single run of the command.
** Pros: Will create efficiency for the user.
** Cons: Difficult to implement, particularly if a mix of valid and invalid indices are entered
as arguments.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
