== Introduction

=== What is OASIS?

Office Assistance Specialized Integration System (OASIS) is an all-in-one office management software. It has the common of management system and additional features that would make managing efficient, quick and fun. Unlike any other management software, OASIS adopts Command Line Interface.

=== Architectural Overview

This document describes the design, implemented features and possible features that could be implemented in OASIS. These could serve as guidelines for future developers. Happy Programming!!

== Setting up

It is time to start, follow the instructions below to get your developing environment ready.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]

==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]

=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]

=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]

=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]

=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::permission
=== Permission System
There are several commands in OASIS that should not be executable by every user. E.g. Add and Delete commands should only be usable by user with the power to hire and dismiss other employees.
Permission system is used to ensure that each user are only able to perform commands that they are authorised to when using OASIS.

==== Current implementation

===== Aspect: Model
Model of a person have been changed to reflect the permission that each user possesses.

The following diagram highlights the class added to reflect the changes to the model for `Person`.

image::permissionPersonModel.png[width="350"]

===== Aspect: Storage
Permission have to be stored in the addressbook where the information for `Person` is stored. This is achieved through creation of `XmlAdaptedPermission`, which was utilised by `XmlAdaptedPerson` to store the information in an xml file.

image::permissionStorage.png[width="350]

===== Aspect: Logic
Commands will be required to populate a `requiredPermission:PermissionSet` object with all `Permission` the command requires user to have to execute the command.

The following is an example on how to assign permission to a Command.

.AddCommand.java
[source,java]
----
public AddCommand(Person person) {
    requireNonNull(person);
    requiredPermission.addPermissions(Permission.ADD_EMPLOYEE);
    toAdd = person;
}
----

Given below is an example scenario of how commands will be executed.

Step 1. The user enters a command `Delete 1` into the CLI.

Step 2. The system retrieves current user's `PermissionSet`

Step 3. The system compares user's `PermissionSet` with `Delete` command's `requiredPermission`.

* Two different cases

** User have required permissions, execute command.

** User don't have required permissions, show error message.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user excutes a command.

image::permissionCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="450"]

==== Design Considerations

* Alternative 1 (Current Implementation): Assign permission to each individual user, and restrict commands executable by user based on permission assigned.

** Pros: Easy to control the commands a user can access.

** Cons: Need to ensure that there is at least 1 user that can assign permissions to other users. Implementation requires knowledge of multiple components of OASIS.

* Alternative 2 : Create subclass of `Person` to be used to identify the role of the user. E.g. `Employee` and `Manager` class.
The commands executable by the user will depend on their class.

** Pros: Easy to implement. Only require small modification in existing classes.

** Cons: Commands cannot be freely assigned to users as it is now dependent on which subclass the user is. E.g. we cannot create an `Employee` with a subset of the commands available to `Manager`.

=== Supporting features for Permission System

The following are features that have been implemented to support the Permission System.

==== Modify Permissions of employee

This feature allows the user to change the Permission that have been allocated to an employee.

[NOTE]
This feature can only be performed by users that have `ASSIGN_PERMISSION` permission.

===== Current Implementation

This feature allows the user to indicate what permission to add and remove based on the prefix.

* `-a PERMISSION_TO_ADD` to add permission
* `-r PERMISSION_TO_REMOVE` to remove permission

To implement this new command syntax, `ModifyPermissionCommandParser` utilises `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize` to generate a `ArgumentMultiMap`. The `ArgumentMultiMap` 's `key` contains the prefix, and `value` contains the list of keywords that succeeded the prefix. There will also be a `preamble` which can be used to retrieve the `index` of the targeted employee.

The list of keywords is then used to create `permissionToAdd:Set<Permission>` and `permissionToRemove:Set<Permission>`, depending on their prefix. The 2 sets, together with the index, will be then be used to create `ModifyPermissionCommand`.

 Might want to insert code snippet here

When `ModifyPermissionCommand` is executed, it will then modify the permission of targeted employee, adding permission in `permissionToAdd` and removing permissions in `permissionToRemove`.

The following is a sequence diagram that visualizes how this operation works.

image::modifyPermissionSequenceDiagram.png[width="350]


==== View Permissions of employee

This feature allows the user to view the permissions that have been allocated to an employee.

[NOTE]
This feature can only be performed by users that have `ASSIGN_PERMISSION` permission.


// end::permission

// tag::project
=== Assignment Management
Assignment management is an important feature in company management system. As such there are four critical features of assignment management. These features are `addassignment`, `listassignment`, `deleteassignment` and `assignassignment`.

These commands could only be executed by user with the appropriate permission.

==== Proposed Implementation

===== Aspect: Model
Model of the assignment has been created. `Assignment` will store information such as the `assignmentName`, `assignmentAuthor` and `assignmentDescription`.

The following diagram shows the class added to reflect the model `Assignment`:

image::ProjectModel.PNG[width="450"]

===== Aspect: Storage
Add `XmlSerializableAssignmentList` and `XmlAdaptAssignment` class to Storage component. `XmlAdaptAssignment` will then have the element for assignment name, assignment author and assignment description.

The following diagram shows the class `XmlSerializableAssignmentList` added to reflect the changes in storage component:

image::XmlSerializableProjectList.PNG[width="450"]

==== Aspect: Logic
When user enter the commands related to assignment, the commands will be parser to correct execution. Below are the examples scenarios:

===== Add Project
Step 1. The user enters a command `addassignment` into the CLI.

Step 2. The system parses the command to execute `AddAssignmentCommand`.

Step 3. The system parses the assignment information to the respective fields.

Step 4. The System checks if there exist the same assignment.
* Two different cases:
** If no existing assignment, stores the assignment.
** If there is existing assignment, inform the user and do not store the assignment.

Step 5. The system shows the result of the command.

===== Delete Assignment
Step 1. The user enters a command `deleteAssignment 1` into the CLI.

Step 2. The system parses the command to execute `DeleteAssignmentCommand`.

Step 3. The system locates the index and delete the assignment and its information.

===== Assign Assignment
Step 1. The user enters a command `assignassignment 1 -n Alex` into the CLI.

Step 2. The system parses the command to execute `AssignAssignmentCommand`.

Step 3. The system parses the information.

Step 4. Check if selected name is available.

Step 4. The system assigns the selected assignment into the `Assignment` attribute of user.

===== List Assignment
Step 1. The user enters a command `listassignment` into the CLI.

Step 2. The system parses the command to execute `ListAssignmentCommand`.

Step 3. The system retrieves all assignments.

Step 4. The system lists the assignments.

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Storage
* Alternative 1 (Current Choice): store assignment information in Xml file.

** Pros: Xml file has extensibility, as it has no fixed set of tags. Allowing future developers to enhance the information of the assignment.
** Cons: Inefficient retrieval of information of the assignment when the storage size gets too big.

* Alternative 2: store the assignment information using database system.

** Pros: Fast and efficient retrieval of information, even when the amount of data is massive.
** Cons: Separated system needs to be set up to store information. Additional cost.

// end::project

// tag::archive[]
=== View deleted employee archive feature
Employees with the "Department manager" permissions are allowed to delete employees in the system - related to firing employees in real life. Deleted employees in the system will not be shown in the display list but be moved to an archive list instead. Objects in the archive list can then be restored to the system or be permanently deleted.

==== Proposed implementation
The view deleted employee archive feature is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook` and `UniqueArchiveList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the UniqueArchiveList behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state and an empty `UniqueArchiveList` is maintained.

Step 2. The user executes delete 3 command to delete the 3rd person in the address book. The Person object from the `UniquePersonList` will be transferred to the `UniqueArchiveList` and now the `UniqueArchiveList` will store all the deleted persons details.

Step 3a.1 The user views `UniqueArchiveList` and executes delete 1 command to delete the 1st person in the archive list.

Step 3a.2 The selected Person object in the `UniqueArchiveList` will be permanently deleted from the storage.

Step 3b.1 The user views `UniqueArchiveList` and execute restore 1 command to restored 1st person in the archive list to the address book.

Step 3a.1 The selected Person object in the `UniqueArchiveList` will be transferred back to `UniquePersonList`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes remove and restore command:

image::archiveActivityDiagram.PNG[width="350]

===== Aspect: Model
Added a `UniqueArchiveList` object to a `VersionedAddressBook` object. `UniqueArchiveList` will store 0 or more `Person` objects.

The following diagram shows the class `UniqueArchiveList` added to reflect the changes in the Model component:

image::modelChangeJosh.PNG[width="350]

===== Aspect: Storage
Added a `XmlSerializableArchiveList` object to Storage component.

The following diagram shows the class `XmlSerializableArchiveList` added to reflect the changes in the Storage component:

image::storageModelChangeJosh.PNG[width="350]

===== Aspect: UI
Added a `ArchiveDisplay` object to `MainWindow` of UI component.

The following diagram shows the class `ArchiveDisplay` added to reflect the changes in the UI component:

image::uiModelChangeJosh.PNG[width="350]

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Lifetime of objects in Archive list
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deleted permanently after being removed by user again.
** Pros: Guaranteed no loss of data if an employee is accidentally deleted.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage as employee records stored a few years back could still be stored.
* **Alternative 2:** Deleted after a certain number of time has passed.
** Pros: More efficient memory usage wont store old employee records which could cause high memory usage.
** Cons: Loss of data possible if an employee is accidentally deleted and not restored right away.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the archive commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the archived employee objects.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Only require small modification in existing classes. Faster access to archive list as you don't have to search every employee in the system to get the employees archived.
** Cons: We must maintain a separate list for archived objects.
* **Alternative 2:** Assign an archive attribute to each employee object and show only in the system if archived attribute is false. In contrast show in the archive display list if archive attribute is true.
** Pros: Only need to change 1 attribute when an employee is deleted.
** Cons: "Archive" is an unusual attribute for a person and it will be time consuming to view the archive list as you have to go through all employees to check the archive attribute.
// end::archive[]

// tag::login[]
=== Login/Logout feature
==== Current Implementation

The Login/Logout feature is facilitated through the use of creating a login screen before the application begins, ensuring that the user starts by logging into his account.

These operations are exposed in the MainWindow class through `fillLoginParts()`, `removeLoginWindow()`, `removeInnerElements()`, `processLogin(LoginEvent)` and `processLogout(LogoutEvent)`

[NOTE]
While the login screen is displayed, other usual UI elements, such as the `browserPanel`, `PersonListPanel`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter`, `CommandBox` are not initialized at all, so they cannot be accessed.

[NOTE]
To ensure that most tests still work with a login system, the `MainWindowHandle`, used by all GUI tests, automatically logs the user in right after the UI element loads.

The following steps show how the program works as the user login:

1. When the program is started, UIManager creates the MainWindow and tells it to `fillLoginParts()`.

2. The user enters his details, and clicks login.

3. This causes the `LoginForm` to fire a `LoginEvent` onto the central EventBus, with the username and password saved into the `LoginEvent`.

4. The Logic Manager catches the LoginEvent. It then checks if the username and password combination matches a person in the system, or the admin user. To do so, it communicates with the `model` to retrieve everyone in the system.

a. If there is no successful match, then a `FailedLoginEvent` is fired. The LoginForm catches this Event and displays the error message provided by the FailedLoginEvent.

5. If there is a successful match, then a `SuccessfulLoginEvent` is fired. This event contains the person that is currently logging in, wrapped in a User object.

6. The `mainWindow` class catches the `SuccessfulLoginEvent` and processes it, removing the login UI Elements and replacing it with `fillInnerParts()`

The following sequence diagram fully shows the steps involved:

image::LoginSequenceDiagram.png[]

When the user wishes to logout, he enters logout, which triggers the following:

1. The `LogoutEvent` is fired by the `LogoutCommand`.

2. The `mainWindow` class catches the `LogoutCommand` and processes it, removing the main UI elements and replacing it with the `fillLoginParts()`

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the login screen is displayed

The login screen needs to be displayed to the user in some fashion.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a login screen before initializing other UI elements on the fly.
** Pros: One single window. Clear to the user which window to focus on. Most applications work this way, so it should be familiar to the majority of our users.
** Cons: Harder to implement. Need to take into account other possible UI elements, preload only those that are required, and ensure that tests stay supported.
* **Alternative 2:** Build another UI Window just for login. Before logging in, this window will popup up. Once the user has logged in, the login window will close and the main window will pop up.
** Pros: Far easier to implement. Login system abstracted away from other functionality.
** Cons: It will be hard to maintain the same window size as the login window, if the user resizes it. More coupling would be required to maintain the same window size. Very odd and unfamiliar to most users. No application today opens a login window, then on successful login, closes that login window and opens a new one, meant for the user to use. This can cause a lot of user confusion. They may think that:
*** The new window is representing error message, it should not have opened.
*** The application had an error and unexpectedly shutdown.
*** The new window is from another application that the user has running on his computer.
*** They did something wrong (perhaps they pressed the button to close the window instead?)
*** The developers are idiots.

===== Aspect: UI Elements to build the login system

When OASIS boots up, the login screen needs to be displayed. The UI elements used to build this login screen needs to be decided on where they should go on the screen.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using the same placeholders already available, place the appropriate UI elements on the screen.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Utilizes the same placeholders currently in the system, so will adapt the same way to window re-sizing.
** Cons: Looks uglier than if the window was created solely to enter login data
* **Alternative 2:** Build the window from scratch to show login UI elements.
** Pros: Nicer, the UI elements are built for login
** Cons: Harder to implement. Need a good graphic designer to plan out how said nice login screen would look like, otherwise it'd just look bad and you might as well go with Alternative 1.

===== Aspect: How the UI and Logic elements should communicate.

Whenever a login is done by the User, the `UI`, `Logic` and `Model` elements need to communicate to handle the event.

* The `UI` needs to provide the User Input information.
* The `Logic` needs to perform the check of whether this is a valid Username and Password combination.
* The `Model` needs to provide the data for the logic to do it's work.

There needs to be a solution to handle this cleanly and without causing unnecessary coupling, as this will likely be required to be extended upon in the long run.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilize the EventBus to allow `UI`, `Model` and `Logic` to communicate
** Pros: Reduces coupling, as UI, Model and Logic doesn't need to know about each other. If required, other classes can also listen for the Event and process accordingly
** Cons: Needs some work to implement. Requires building up new classes.
* **Alternative 2:** Let UI, Logic and Model know about each other, allowing them to call the relevant methods and do the relevant checks
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Grealy increases coupling. Not a good design decision, as it will make it harder to maintain the code in the future.
* **Alternative 3:** Build a command like system (similar to how Commands are implemented in the system) for UI to talk to Logic. Logic then uses the Command system to reply back to UI.
** Pros: Reduces the amount of coupling added into the system. Provides a way for UI to get Logic to do things, in case more functionality is added that uses UI input.
** Cons: Very time consuming to implement. Hard to design as there is no clear functionality that might also need this system in the future.

==== Username and Password storage

To store username and password, the class `Person` has been extended to include a Username and Password variable as well. These two variables represent the Username and Password stored in the system for that Person.

==== Admin account

There is a possibility that the entire system is cleared of all employees (i.e when initializing, or an accidental deleting of all employees). To resolve this issue, an admin account is added that will ensure that there is always a user that can login in. The admin account cannot be removed and always has full access rights. By default, the username of the admin account is `Admin` and the password is `Pa55w0rd`.

[NOTE]
The password of the admin account can be modified through the `passwd` command.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Where the admin account password can be stored.

Since the admin account would cause the system to be very insecure if it's password couldn't be changed, the admin account password must be changeable and stored somewhere, so that it persists across sessions. But where?

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Place the storage in User Preferences
** Pros: Easy to implement. A nice, centralized place to store general application information.
** Cons: If the file is deleted, then the password will revert back to the default, which leaves the admin account vulnerable.
** As we plan to store the system in a central server, the admin account's information will be stored in the server, and not locally. As this is intended to change before the final release, we went for the option that is the simplest to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Add it into the address book.xml file
** Pros: If the password was attempted to be removed through the deletion of the file, then this will also delete everyone in the system as well, thus rendering the access to the admin account useless.
** Cons: Since the file is stored in an xml format, it is easy for any dedicated attacker to find and remove the password information, reverting it to the default. Harder to implement, as would require large changes in the address book parser.
* **Alternative 3:** Store it within environment variables
** Pros: Somewhat harder to find. Ensures that admin password remains even when the data files are deleted.
** Cons: The admin password would not transfer over systems for the average user. It would be difficult and require technical knowledge of the user to get it to transfer.

==== passwd Command

To change the password, a passwd command is required. However, this command is very different from the other commands. Specifically, it requires a chain of input, and subsequent inputs from the user should not be stored in history (otherwise the user's password are easily retrievable).

This is, however, not easy to handle. This command history is automatically populated by `LogicManager`, which `Command.execute` does not have access to. To complicate things further, `CommandParser` doesn't handle exceptions like storing a command for future use, or redirecting user input to a specific Command.

To resolve this issue, `CommandResult` is extended to hold interceptors - a list of `ProcessCommand`. `ProcessCommand` is a functional interface, similar to Function except that it can throw a specific error as well. To implement passwd, it returns an implementor of `ProcessCommand` to `CommandResult`, which forwards it to `LogicManager`.

`LogicManager` now accepts `ProcessCommand` from `CommandResult`, adding them to a list. As long as there exists at least one `ProcessCommand`, further messages are pushed to `ProcessCommand` instead of processed normally, and they aren't added to history.

Other possible design considerations are shown below.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to implement the passwd Command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Build a foundation of `ProcessCommand` that will intercept user input and process it instead. If it does so, `LogicManager` doesn't add the command to history.
** Pros: Doesn't increase coupling unnecessarily. Allows other functions to utilize this, allowing other commands to also easily extend to a chain of user inputs.
** Cons: Harder to implement. Somewhat hard to understand, as it requires knowledge of lambdas and functional interfaces.
* **Alternative 2:** Apply a hack for passwd where `LogicManager` checks that if a passwd command is ongoing, it redirects there instead.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Greatly increases coupling. If further commands were to require the same functionality, this hack would need to be done again for that function.

// end::login[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::leaveapplication[]
=== Leave Application
==== Current Implementation

A leave application is represented by a `LeaveApplication` model object. The following sequence diagram illustrates how an application for leave by an employee works:

image::LeaveApplicationSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the leave application mechanism behaves when a new leave application is made by an employee:

1. The user executes the `leave add -de DESCRIPTION -da DATE [-da DATE...]` command. The `LeaveApplication` will be initialized with the specified `Description`, and one or more `Date`. Its `LeaveId` will be assigned depending on the number of `LeaveApplication` already recorded in the application, and its `LeaveStatus` will be the initial value of `PENDING`.

image::LeaveApplicationModelDiagram.png[width="400"]

2. The new `LeaveApplication` will then be added to its corresponding `Person`, which represents the employee that applied for the leave.

3. The `LeaveApplication` will be copied and transformed to become an `XmlAdaptedLeaveApplication` object, which is then added into the `XmlAdaptedPerson` and finally saved into a file by the <<25-storage-component, Storage>> component.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How a `LeaveApplication` is stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves it only as a part of `Person`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: We need to go through every `Person` to retrieve a list of all  `LeaveApplication` in the system.
* **Alternative 2:** Stores it only as a part of `AddressBook`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: We need to go through every `LeaveApplication` in the system when retrieving the `LeaveApplication` for a particular `Person`.
* **Alternative 3:** Stores it as a part `Person` as well as `AddressBook`.
** Pros: Fast retrieval for a particular `Person`, as well as for the entire list of `LeaveApplication`s from `AddressBook`.
** Cons: Redundant and duplicate storage for each `LeaveApplication`. We need to ensure that when adding, editing, and deleting a `LeaveApplication`, it is updated correctly in both parts of the Model as well as Storage.
// end::leaveapplication[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

[NOTE]
You may encounter a problem with running Gradle commands on the command line, with the following error message: Cannot find System Java Compiler. Ensure that you have installed a JDK (not just a JRE) and configured your JAVA_HOME system variable to point to the according directory.
If you encounter this error, you can apply the fix shown https://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-set-java_home-on-windows-10/[here] for Windows.

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
////
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.
*** Do read the commits one at a time if you feel overwhelmed.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
