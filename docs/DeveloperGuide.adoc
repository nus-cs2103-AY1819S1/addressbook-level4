By: `Team T16-4`      Since: `Sep 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.planner.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the T16-4 branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1818S1-T16-4/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1818S1-T16-4/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, you can get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API
in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete c/CS1010`.

.Component interactions for `delete c/CS1010` command (part 1)
image::DeleteModuleSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ModulePlannerChangedEvent` when the Module Planner data are changed,
instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results
in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect
the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete c/CS1010` command (part 2)
image::DeleteModuleEventHandlingSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model`
having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us
reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`,
`ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `FindModulePanel` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching
`.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ModulePlannerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete c/CS1010")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Module Planner data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed'
e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// tag::storage[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in JSON format and read it back.
* can save `ReadOnlyModulePlanner` object in JSON format and read it back.

.Interactions inside the Storage component for whenever `ModulePlannerChangedEvent` is fired.

// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.planner.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::moduleinfo[]
=== Module and Academic Major Information

Information about modules and academic majors supports almost all the features in Module Planner.

Information of a module such as module code, module credit and prerequisite modules are stored in `ModuleInfo` class.
This class is made to be immutable to avoid accidental changes to the class.

==== Current Implementation
===== Overview of components

Internally, `ModuleInfo` is an immutable class that holds all the information of a module that is universal to
all students from any faculty. `MajorDescription` is an immutable class that holds information about the
requirements of an academic major.

.Class diagram for `ModuleInfo`.
image::ModuleInfoClassDiagram.png[width="450"]

.Class diagram for `MajorDescription`.
image::MajorDescriptionClassDiagram.png[width="700"]

==== Simplifications

The real information about NUS modules are very complicated. Here we list down some simplifications we made in order
to create this proof of concept of our application.

===== Prerequisites and preclusion

IVLE provides the prerequisites and preclusions of a module in normal English sentence (e.g. "CS1010 or its equivalents"
and "Departmental approval"). Extracting the real module prerequisite and preclusion relationship would
be infeasible due to the potential long list of exceptions we need to handle. To simplify this, we use
regular expression to extract the module codes.

Here is how prerequisite and preclusion checking is implemented:

* If user wants to take Module A, all prerequisites of Module A must already have been taken.
* If Module B's preclusions has at least one module that user has already taken, user cannot take Module B.

This gives us a reasonable approximation of prerequisite and preclusion relationship for most modules.

===== Corequisites

Corequisite is used to describe which modules must be taken together. We choose to ignore this entirely
as it will complicate the implementation of `add` and `delete` commands significantly.

===== Old modules that have been phased out

NUS sometimes creates new modules to replace outdated modules every academic year. Information about
outdated modules are not given by IVLE, but other modules might still list these module codes in their prerequisites
and preclusion. We assume that all module codes referenced in our processed data must have a `ModuleInfo`
object. To do that, all references of module codes that do not have its own module information entry
are removed.

==== Data sanitizing script

The python script that downloads the list of NUS modules from https://nusmods.com[NUSMods] server and does the data
transformation detailed above can be found at (link:{repoURL}/tools/moduleConverter.py[`moduleConverter.py`]).

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Representation of academic major and focus area

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use enum to represent academic major and focus area.
** Pros: Stronger type checking.
** Cons: Need to explicitly list down all the possible values of enums (there are more than hundreds of focus areas
in all NUS academic majors). Special JSON serialization and deserialization is needed for enum types.
* **Alternative 2**: Use `String` to represent academic major and focus area.
** Pros: No need to convert academic major and focus area inputted by user into another type.
** Cons: If academic major/focus area is passed into a function as a parameter, the function cannot assume that
the it is a valid academic major/focus area. This leads to a lot of redundant checking.

===== Aspect: Storing of module and academic major information

To avoid having to download the module and academic major information from the Internet in first start up, we package
the data directly into final `.jar` file as a resource file.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Store data in as a JSON resource file and deserialize data into Java types
at runtime.
** Pros: JSON format is easy to learn and can be manipulated easily with other (interpreted) programming languages.
** Cons: JSON format can only hold simple primitive types such as `String`, number, array and hash table. Need to
design a way to flatten the module dependency graph into something that can be represented in JSON and reconstruct
the graph after deserialization.
* **Alternative 2**: Generate Java code during build time. The data will be directly stored as a static constant Java object.
** Pros: Better performance in runtime as the deserialization is no longer needed. Less moving parts when testing the data itself.
** Cons: More complex build procedures. Teammates will need to install extra tools to build the project.

===== Aspect: Class representation of module related information

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use `ModuleInfo` class to represent module information that is transparent to user's academic major
and `ModuleDescription` class to represent module information that is specific to the requirements of an academic major.
** Pros: Clear separation of concern. Commands that does not depend on `UserProfile` only needs to
interact with `ModuleInfo` and not affected by changes to `ModuleDescription`.
** Cons: Commands that need module information specific to an academic major (e.g. `suggest` and `status`) still need
to depend on `ModuleInfo`.
* **Alternative 2**: Use one class to hold all types of module information.
** Pros: Less classes to reason about.
** Cons: Commands that use `ModuleInfo` but do not uses `UserProfile` directly will still be affected by changes
in `UserProfile`. The JSON form of the data will be more complex.

// end::moduleinfo[]

// tag::setup[]

=== Setup feature
==== Current Implementation

The `setup` command allows users to save their academic major and optionally their focus areas in Module Planner.
The information is stored in `UserProfile` and is later used by `suggest` and `status` commands.

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence when `setup` command is executed.

.Sequence diagram for `setup` command.
image::SetupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Argument leniency
* **Alternative 1**: Entirely reject all focus areas even if only one of them is invalid. Focus areas must have the exact same letter casing as
listed in User Guide.
** Pros: Implementation would be simpler.
** Cons: Not user friendly. It is too easy for user to input focus areas in the wrong letter casing, causing many retries.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Accept the valid focus areas even if one of them is invalid. Focus areas inputted is case-insensitive.
** Pros: More user friendly. User is able to update the user profile and gets positive result even if there are some minor syntax errors.
** Cons: Need to implement filtering of valid focus areas from inputted focus areas. As `f/Computer Science` and `f/cOmpUter SciEnce` are now
both valid inputs and can be inputted at the same time, we also need to filter out duplicates.

===== Aspect: Error handling
* **Alternative 1**: Execute syntax format checkings one by one and immediately throw command exception in first failure.
** Pros: Implementation would be simpler. Less possible of negative test cases to test.
** Cons: Not user friendly. User only sees one syntax error at one time. If there are many syntax errors in user's first try, it will take
several retries for user to figure all the syntax errors.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Always execute all syntax format checkings. If there are more than one error, concatenate their error
message before throwing command exception.
** Pros: More user friendly. User will be able to see all syntax errors in first try and attempt to fix them.
** Cons: Need to create many negative test cases to test each error individually and all together. More
complicated to test the expected error messages.

// end::setup[]

// tag::add[]
=== Add feature
==== Current Implementation

The add mechanism is facilitated by `ModulePlanner`. `ModulePlanner` stores a list of `Semester` objects. A `Semester` stores a list containing modules that the user has taken or is planning to take on that semester.

Add mechanism is also facilitated by the posting and handling of events. The `AddCommand#execute(...)` is the event poster and
the `MainWindow#handleAddEvent(...)` is the event handler.

The implementation is as follows:

* `ModulePlanner#addModules(List<Module> modules, int index)` -- Add the list of `modules` into the semester specified by `index`.

The operation above is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addModules(List<Module> modules, int index)`

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

In executing the add operation, the AddCommand will apply several filters on the input list of modules.

Consider the following case:

ModulePlanner contains only `CS1010` in year 1 semester 1 and the user tries to add the following list of modules : `CS0000`,
`CS1010`, `CS1010E`, `CS1231`, `MA1100`, `CS2030`, `GER1000` to year 1 semester 1. The filterings, sequentially,
are as follows:

===== (1) Filter out module(s) not offered by the education institute
Module `CS0000` is not offered. It will be filtered out from the list and the user will be informed that it is not an offered module.

===== (2) Filter out module(s) that already exist in the planner
Module `CS1010` is already in the planner. It will be filtered out from the list and the user will be informed that it exists in the planner.

===== (3) Filter out module(s) which some of its preclusion is in the planner
Module `CS1010E` has `CS1010` as its preclusion. It will be filtered out from the list and the user will be informed that this module
has some of its preclusion in the planner.

===== (4) Filter out equivalent modules
Modules `CS1231` and `MA1100` are equivalent. These modules will be filtered out from the list, then grouped by equivalence and
the user will be told that these modules are equivalence.

===== (5) Filter out module(s) which some of its prerequisites has not been fulfilled.
Module `CS2030` has `CS1010` as its prerequisite. To be able to add it to the planner, `CS1010` must exist in previous semesters,
which in this case is not possible since the semester to be added is the the earliest semester possible. Thus the module will be
filtered out from the list and the user will be informed that the prerequisites for this module is not fulfilled yet.

===== (6) Add the filtered list of module(s) to the planner
At this point, the list to be added has been finalized. The `Model#addModules(List<Module> modules, int index)` is then called
to add this list of module(s) (in this case only `GER1000`) to the planner.

[NOTE]
(1) The messages for each filtering will be collected and displayed simultaneously to the user. +
(2) If the final filtered list is empty, the command box will not be emptied so the user do not need to type all over again.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Different semester start
The current implementation allows users to explore possible scenarios of study plan that they can make. Assuming a user is already
in the middle of his study, let's say he is in second year already, he can still modify his first year's modules to see other
possible study plans. Implementing a way to initialize ModulePlanner based on the user's past modules (which they can't modify after initializing)
would be a good idea for the following reasons:

1. To mirror the real world - it is impossible for a student to void a module that has already been taken.

2. To prevent undefined behaviour - omitting a module already taken might make all future modules not yet taken to be inaccurately planned.
Also, all currently suggested modules to the user might too be inaccurate.

Below are the summary of pros and cons of the current implementation and the alternative design:

* Current implementation: Able to plan for every semester
** Pros: Allow users to explore various study plans
** Cons: Doesn't enforce users to deal with their real progress

* Alternative design: Only able to plan for future semester, with some initialization
** Pros: Allow users to commit on their real progress
** Cons: Harder implementation

// end::add[]

// tag::delete[]
=== Delete feature

==== Current Implementation
===== About
The current delete mechanism is facilitated by `ModulePlanner`.
`ModulePlanner` stores a list of all the semesters the user has taken and will take.
In turn, `Semester` stores a list of the modules the user has taken, is currently taking or will be taking.

===== Process
When a module is deleted, `ModulePlanner` will go through every module added after the semester which the
module is deleted from and checks if those modules now have prerequisites that are not fulfilled. If there
are now prerequisites not fulfilled for the modules checked, they too are deleted and the process repeats for them.
This process is the same for when multiple modules are deleted. For better addressing, this process will be defined
as _Iterative Deletion_.

The following activity diagram shows how Iterative Deletion works:

image::IterativeDeletionActivityDiagram.png[width="500"]

===== Input
The arguments given to the mechanism are modules, which can be a mix of valid and invalid modules.
A valid module is defined as one that has the correct module code format and has been taken, is currently
being taken or will be taken by the user (is stored in the module planner). An invalid module is defined as the opposite.

===== Result
Out of all these arguments, only the valid modules will be deleted from the module planner. The invalid modules
are collected and made known to the user through the Result Display. The modules that are not found in the module planner
are shown to the user in the Result Display. Modules with invalid module code formats are already filtered out by the
`DeleteCommandParser` and hence do not appear as part of the message shown in the Result Display.

`ModulePlanner` uses the following operation to implement the delete mechanism:

* `ModulePlanner#deleteModules(List<Module> modules)` -- Deletes the modules from whatever semester it is in.

The above operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteModules(List<Module> modules)`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `delete` operation works:

image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]

Below are some usage scenarios.
For convenience, let's define some valid modules: CS1010, CS2030 and CS2040
and an invalid module CS0000. CS1010 is one of the prerequisites for CS2030 and CS2040.
Let's also initialise a module planner with those valid modules: +

[cols="^,^", width=50%]
.Module Planner Initial State
|===
| Y1S1 | Y1S2

|CS1010
|CS2030

|
|CS2040
|===

===== A Valid Module
The user executes `delete c/CS1010` command to delete the valid module CS1010.
The `delete` command calls `Model#deleteModules(...)`, which removes the module from the semester where it is found.
Iterative Deletion is then applied. Since CS2030 and CS2040 have CS1010 as a prerequisite, if CS1010 is
deleted, CS2030 and CS2040 will be deleted too.

The module planner now has this state: +
[cols="^,^", width=50%]
.Module Planner Current State
|===
| Y1S1 | Y1S2

|empty
|empty

|===

[NOTE]
This applies to when more than one valid module is supplied.

===== An Invalid Module
The user executes `delete c/CS0000` command. However, since that module is not found in the module planner,
the command fails and `Model#deleteModules(...)` will not be called. The user will be informed of the invalid module.

The module planner now has this state: +
[cols="^,^", width=50%]
.Module Planner Current State
|===
| Y1S1 | Y1S2

|CS1010
|CS2030

|
|CS2040
|===

[NOTE]
This applies to where more than one invalid module is supplied.

===== Mix of Valid and Invalid Modules
The user executes `delete c/CS2030 c/CS0000`. However, only the module CS2030 is valid.
In this case, `Model#deleteModules(...)` is still called, but only the valid module CS2030 will be deleted.
The user will be informed of the invalid module.

[NOTE]
This applies to where more than one valid and invalid modules are supplied.

The module planner now has this state: +
[cols="^,^", width=50%]
.Module Planner Current State
|===
| Y1S1 | Y1S2

|`CS1010`
|`CS2040`
|===

===== No Modules
The user executes `delete`. As the command has no supplied arguments, the command will fail
and the user will be informed to input arguments.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Argument leniency
* Alternative 1: Entirely reject modules even if one is invalid.
** Pros: Simple logic and requires minimal code.
** Cons: Not user friendly. The user now has to expend additional effort to edit the modules inputted.

* Alternative 2 (current choice): Accept the valid modules even if one is invalid.
** Pros: User friendly. The user gets to delete the valid modules and is notified of which modules are invalid and why.
** Cons: More complex. Requires filtering logic.

===== Aspect: Iterative Deletion
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Iterate through the modules in each semester for all years. For each semester, the modules
that do not have their prerequisite(s) fulfilled are marked as invalid and are deleted.
** Pros: Simple logic and requires minimal code.
** Cons: Although the number of modules in the module planner is weakly limited by NUS (students are only
   required to take about 40 modules to earn a degree), the algorithm is slow.

* Alternative 2: Construct a direct acyclic graph for all the modules in the module planner
** Pros: Fast and efficient. There is no need to iterative through several semesters to mark modules as invalid and then
   deleting them.
** Cons: More complex. Due to time constraints during the project, this approach was not taken.

// end::delete[]

// tag::find[]

=== Find feature
==== Current Implementation
===== About
The find mechanism is facilitated by the posting and handling of events. The `FindCommand#execute(...)` is the event poster
and the `MainWindow#handleFindEvent(...)` is the event handler. `find` allows the user to retrieve more information about
a specified module.

===== Input
The argument given to the mechanism is a module, which has to be offered by NUS. If a module is not offered,
the command fails.

===== Result
The information about the module is retrieved and displayed in the Multipurpose Panel.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find` operation works:

image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]

Below are some usage scenarios.

==== Module is Offered
The user executes `find c/CS1010`. The Multipurpose Panel displays the retrieved module information.

==== Module is Not Offered
The user executes `find c/CS0000`. The Multipurpose Panel does not display anything.

// end::find[]

// tag::goto[]

=== Goto feature
==== Current Implementation
===== About
The goto mechanism is facilitated by the posting and handling of events. The `GoToCommand#execute(...)` is the event poster
and the `MainWindow#handleGoToEvent(...)` is the event handler. `goto` allows the user to switch between time periods in the ui.
A time period is defined as a year-semester pair. e.g. Year 1 semester 1

===== Input
The argument given to the mechanism is a year-semester pair. The year has to be between 1 and 4, and the semester has to be
between 1 and 2.

===== Result
The ui switches time periods to the specified. The modules taken in the time period is displayed too.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `goto` operation works:

image::GoToSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]

Below are some usage scenarios.

===== Valid Year and Semester
The user executes `goto y/1 s/1`. Since both the year and semester are valid, the ui changes accordingly.

===== Invalid Year and Valid Semester
The user executes `goto y/5 s/1`. Since only the semester is valid, command fails and the ui does not change.

[NOTE]
This applies to when the year is valid but the semester is invalid.

[NOTE]
It is possible that some users take a 5th year and beyond in their education institute. However, as of now, Module Planner does not
support years beyond the 4th.

// end::goto[]

// tag::list[]
=== List feature
==== Current Implementation

The list mechanism displays either a list of modules that the user has added to a specified year or a list of all modules that the user has added to every year.

This mechanism is facilitated by `ModulePlanner`. The `ModulePlanner` stores a list of all `Semester`-s and each `Semester` stores a list `modulesTaken` containing modules that the user has added to that `Semester`.
It implements the following operation:

* `ModulePlanner#getTakenModules()` -- Retrieves the list `takenModules`.
* `ModulePlanner#listTakenModulesAll()` -- Updates `takenModules` to contain a list of modules retrieved from the list `modulesTaken` in every `Semester`.
* `ModulePlanner#listTakenModulesForYear(int year)` -- Updates `takenModules` to contain a list of modules retrieved from the list `modulesTaken` in the `Semester`-s that belong to the specified year.

The operations are exposed in `Model` interface as `Model#getTakenModules()`, `Model#listTakenModulesAll()`, and `Model#listTakenModulesForYear(int year)`.

If a valid year is specified by the user, the `list` command will call `Model#listTakenModulesForYear(year)`, where `year` is the argument supplied by user. If no year is specified, the `list` command will call `Model#listTakenModulesAll()`.

[NOTE]
A valid year should be an integer between 1 to 4 inclusive.

*Below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism works.*

Step 1. User launches the application. `ModulePlanner` is initialised with 8 `Semester` objects in a list `semesters`.

Step 2. User executes `add y/1 s/1 c/CS1231`. The `add` command inserts `Module` CS1231 to the list `modulesTaken` for `Semester` object with index 0.

Step 3. User executes `add y/2 s/1 c/CS1010`. The `add` command inserts `Module` CS1010 to the list `modulesTaken` for `Semester` object with index 2.

Step 4. User wants to see the list of modules taken for year 1 by executing `list y/1`. The `list` command updates `takenModules` to contain list of modules taken in year 1 and retrieves it.
A list containing CS1231 will be displayed to the user.

Step 5. User wants to see the list of modules taken for all years by executing `list`. The `list` command updates `takenModules` to contain list of modules taken in all years and retrieves it.
A list containing CS1231 and CS1010 will be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation when a valid year is specified:

image::ListSequenceDiagram_1.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation when no year is specified:

image::ListSequenceDiagram_2.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How list of modules taken is retrieved for list command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Updates list of modules taken whenever it is modified by a command (e.g. `add`) and immediately retrieves the list upon `list` command.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of running time if commands that modify the list are called frequently.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves all commands that modify list of modules taken without applying it and updates the list based on the commands only when it is retrieved upon `list` command.
** Pros: May be more effective in terms of running time because it only modifies the list when needed.
** Cons: Implementation will be more complicated as it required storing all commands that modify the list.
// end::list[]

// tag::status[]
=== Status feature
==== Current Implementation

Status feature allows the user to keep track of their credit progress for different requirements. It is tracked in the `ModulePlanner` in form of a map and will
be updated every time the user use the add or delete feature and when they set up their profile. This map will then later posted
by `StatusCommand#execute(...)` in an event. Finally `MainWindow#handleStatusEvent(...)` will handle this event and convert the
map to a string for display.

The implementation is as follows:

*`ModulePlanner#getStatus()`-Updates and retrieves the status of credit progress in the `ModulePlanner`

The operation above is exposed in `Model` as `Model#getStatus()`.

Below shows the sequence diagram which describe how the status feature works:

image::StatusSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

Initially, status feature will display progress for degree requirements which does not include unrestricted electives and focus area requirements.
When the user sets up their focus area, additional field(s) of `Focus_Area_Requirement` will be added to the status. The additional field(s) are named
"Focus Area Requirement 1", "Focus Area Requirement 2" and so on, with the number of additional fields is equal to the number of focus area that the
user has.

As an illustration, consider the following case:

Initially, the ModulePlanner is empty and the user does not have any focus area. Using the status feature will display the following strings:

University Level Requirement: 0/20 +
Foundation: 0/36 +
Mathematics: 0/12 +
Science: 0/4 +
IT Professionalism: 0/12 +
Industrial Experience Requirement: 0/12 +
Team Project: 0/8

Now the user wants to set up Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence as their focus area. +
The status will now display additional strings as follows:

Focus Area Requirement 1: 0/12 +
Focus Area Requirement 2: 0/12

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Inclusion of Unrestricted Elective requirement
Currently the status doesn't keep track of Unrestricted Elective requirement because of the complexity of how it is counted. Credits
from modules with more than 4 credit count may or may not have its extra credits transferred to UE requirement. For that, a possible alternative
would be to list down all modules with more than 4 credit count that transfer its extra credits to UE credits and taking them into consideration.

Below are the summary of pros and cons of the current implementation and the alternative design

* Current Implementation: Doesn't include Unrestricted Electives
** Pros: Straightforward implementation by just counting for each module
** Cons: Doesn't include all possible degree requirements, hence not real progress

* Alternative Design: Includes Unrestricted Electives
** Pros: Able to track real progress
** Cons: Much more tedious to implement

// end::status[]

// tag::suggest[]
=== Suggest feature
==== Current Implementation

The suggest mechanism displays a list of modules available in the specified index to the user, where index represents the year and semester that the user is asking suggestions for.

This mechanism is supported by an internal list `availableModules` in `ModulePlanner`, which is regenerated after every successful execution of commands that modify `ModulePlanner` (`add`, `delete`, `clear`, etc.) and `suggest` command.
The list `availableModules` can be retrieved through `Model#getAvailableList()` using `suggest` command, which (`suggest` command) takes in two arguments: a valid year and a valid semester.

[NOTE]
====
* A valid year should be an integer between 1 to 4 inclusive.
* A valid semester should be wither 1 or 2.
====

*Below is an example usage scenario and how the suggest mechanism works.*

*Step 1.* User launches the application and `ModulePlanner` is initialized.

*Step 2.* User executes `suggest y/1 s/1`. The `suggest` command parser converts year 1 and semester 1 to index 0.
The `suggest` command updates `availableModules` to a newly generated list of available modules for index 0 and stores index 0 as `availableIndex` in `ModulePlanner`. It then retrieves `availableModules` and displays it to user.

*Step 3.* User executes `add y/1 s/2 c/CS1010`. The `add` command performs adding a module and updates `availableModules` to a newly generated list of available modules for the stored index 0. The suggested modules list shows an updated list of available modules in year 1 semester 1 to the user.
Only `suggest` command will change the index (year and semester) to be displayed by the suggested modules list, other commands will only show an updated list for the last index displayed by `suggest`.

*Step 4.* User executes `suggest y/1 s/2`. The `suggest` command parser converts year 1 and semester 2 to index 1. The `suggest` command updates `availableModules` to a newly generated list of available modules for index 1 and stores index 1 as `availableIndex` in `ModulePlanner`. It then retrieves `availableModules` and displays list of available modules in year 1 semester 2 to user.

*Below is an explanation on how the list of available modules is generated.*

The method `ModulePlanner#generateAvailableModules(int index)` is called by `ModulePlanner#updateModulesAvailable()`, which sets the content of `availableModules` to the list of modules returned by `generateAvailableModules(index)`, with `index` being the stored `availableIndex`. The implementation of `ModulePlanner#generateAvailableModules(int index)` is given below:

[source,java]
----
private List<Module> generateAvailableModules(int index) {
    List<Module> modulesAvailable = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Module> modulesTaken = getAllModulesTaken();
    List<Module> modulesTakenBeforeIndex = getAllModulesTakenBeforeIndex(index);
    List<Module> allModules = getAllModulesFromStorage();

    for (Module m : allModules) {
        if (ModuleUtil.isModuleAvailable(modulesTaken, modulesTakenBeforeIndex, m)) {
            modulesAvailable.add(m);
        }
    }

    sortAvailableModules(modulesAvailable, userProfile);

    return modulesAvailable;
}
----

The method `ModulePlanner#generateAvailableModules(int index)` retrieves all modules from the storage and performs availability checking on each of them. The available modules are put into a list which is then sorted:

** in a lexicographical order if user has specified a major other than *Computer Science* through `setup` command, or
** such that core modules for *Computer Science* major are put on top, followed by general education modules and unrestricted electives.

The availability checking is done by the following method:

[source,java]
----
public static boolean isModuleAvailable(List<Module> modulesTaken,
                                        List<Module> modulesTakenBeforeIndex, Module module) {
    return hasNotTakenModule(modulesTaken, module)
            && hasFulfilledAllPrerequisites(modulesTakenBeforeIndex, module)
            && hasNotFulfilledAnyPreclusions(modulesTaken, module);
}
----

A sample scenario:

Module CS2030 has a prerequisite CS1010 and a preclusion CS1020. User has taken CS1010 in year 1 semester 2 and has not taken CS1020 or CS2030.

* Executing `suggest y/2 s/1` will display CS2030 as one of the available modules, as user has fulfilled all prerequisites of CS2030 before year 2 semester 1 and has not taken any preclusion or the module itself.
* Executing `suggest y/1 s/1` will *not* display CS2030 in the list of available modules, as user has not fulfilled all the prerequisites before year 1 semester 1 (user has only fulfilled CS1010 in the semester after).

The following sequence diagram shows how the suggest operation works:

image::SuggestSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How list of available modules is regenerated
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Regenerates list of available modules after every successful execution of commands that *may* modify the list of available modules.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of running time because list is regenerated even if there is no change to the content.
* **Alternative 2:** Regenerates list of available modules only if a command modifies the content of the list of available modules.
** Pros: May be more effective in terms of running time because it only regenerates the list when needed.
** Cons: Implementation will be more complicated as it requires additional checking on whether a command modifies the list.
// end::suggest[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedModulePlanner`.
It extends `ModulePlanner` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `modulePlannerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedModulePlanner#commit()` -- Saves the current module planner state in its history.
* `VersionedModulePlanner#undo()` -- Restores the previous module planner state from its history.
* `VersionedModulePlanner#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone module planner state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitModulePlanner()`, `Model#undoModulePlanner()` and `Model#redoModulePlanner()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `VersionedModulePlanner` will be initialized with the initial module planner state,
and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single module planner state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete c/GER1000` command to delete the module `GER1000` in the module planner.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitModulePlanner()`, causing the modified state of the module planner
after the `delete c/CS1010` command executes to be saved in the `modulePlannerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer`
is shifted to the newly inserted module planner state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add y/1 s/1 c/CS1010` to add the module `CS1010 to the first year first semester.
The `add` command also calls `Model#commitModulePlanner()`, causing another modified module planner state
to be saved into the `modulePlannerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitModulePlanner()`,
so the module planner state will not be saved into the `modulePlannerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the module was a mistake,
and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoModulePlanner()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left,
pointing it to the previous module planner state, and restores the module planner to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial module planner state,
then there are no previous module planner states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoModulePlanner()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoModulePlanner()`,
which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state,
and restores the module planner to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `modulePlannerStateList.size() - 1`,
pointing to the latest module planner state, then there are no undone module planner states to restore.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoModulePlanner()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`.
Commands that do not modify the module planner, such as `list`,
will usually not call `Model#commitModulePlanner()`, `Model#undoModulePlanner()`
or `Model#redoModulePlanner()`. Thus, the `modulePlannerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitModulePlanner()`.
Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `modulePlannerStateList`,
all module planner states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add y/1 s/1 c/CS1010` command.
This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire module planner.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the module being deleted,
   as well as the year and semester it was in).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of module planner states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedModulePlanner`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands.
Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.planner.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.planner.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.planner.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.planner.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Module Planner depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Glossary

[[mainstream-os]] Mainstream OS::
Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS

Time Period::
Year-Semester pair
* year 1 semester 1
* year 2 semester 2

Iterative Deletion::
The process of removing modules, checking if their removal causes other modules to not fulfill
some of their prerequisites, removing those modules that no longer have their prerequisites fulfilled,
and repeating until no more modules are removed.

Ui Components::
The ui is divided into several sections.

[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown


. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with no modules. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window..
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Adding modules

In an empty module planner, do the following command: `add y/1 s/1 c/CS1010`

The module planner will now have the module `CS1010`.

Next do the following command: `add y/1 s/1 c/CS0000 c/CS1010 c/CS1010E c/CS1231 c/MA1100 c/CS2030 c/GER1000`

The module planner will now have the module `GER1000` and the following message will be displayed:

Added Module(s): GER1000 +
Not offered module(s): CS0000 +
Following module(s) already exist in the planner: CS1010 +
Following module(s) have some of their preclusions not fulfilled in the planner: CS1010E +
Following module(s) are equivalent: (CS1231 MA1100) +
Following module(s) have their prerequisites not fulfilled in the planner: CS2030

=== Getting status

Type `status` in an empty planner, and the following should be displayed:

University Level Requirement: 0/20 +
Foundation: 0/36 +
Mathematics: 0/12 +
Science: 0/4 +
IT Professionalism: 0/12 +
Industrial Experience Requirement: 0/12 +
Team Project: 0/8

Now do the following command: `add y/1 s/1 c/CS1010 c/MA1521`

The following fields will be now updated:
Foundation: 4/36 +
Mathematics: 4/12

=== Deleting modules

. Simple deletion

.. Prerequisite: There needs to be at least one module in the module planner that is *not* a prerequisite
   for other modules. These modules are usually level 1000 modules like CS1010 and GER1000. If no such
   modules are in the module planner, add one or more (e.g. `add y/1 s/1 c/CS1010` and `add y/1 s/1 c/GER1000`).
.. Test case: `delete c/CS1010`. +
   Expected: The module is removed and the ui updates to show that.

. Iterative Deletion

.. Prerequisite: There needs to be at least one module in the module planner that is a prerequisite
   for other modules. These modules are usually level 2000 modules and above like CS2030 and CS2040.
   If no such modules are in the module planner, add one or more (e.g. `add y/1 s/2 c/CS2030` and
   `add y/1 s/2 c/CS2040`).
.. Test case: `delete c/CS1010`. +
   Expected: The module is removed and the ui updates to show that. The modules that depend on CS1010 like
   CS2030 and CS2040 will be removed too.

[TIP]
To observe iterative deletion better, use the `list` command to list out all the modules before performing this test case.

[NOTE]
====

*Potential Confusion* +
An input like `add y/1 s/2 c/CS2030` does not work. +

*Solution* +
Check if the prerequisites of CS2030 have been fulfilled. In this case, the prerequisites of
CS2030 are CS1010 and CS1231. Add the latter two modules before adding CS2030 into at least a
semester after.

====

=== Finding a module

. Finding a valid module

.. Prerequisite: None.
.. Test case: `find c/CS1010` +
   Expected: The Multipurpose Panel displays the information of `CS1010`.

=== Switching between time periods

. Switching to a different time period

.. Prerequisite: None, but the time period that you `goto` has to be different from your current.
.. Test case: `goto y/<a> s/<b>`, where a and b refer to any valid values. +
   Expected: The time period in the Taken Modules Panel will change from where you were to `Year a | Semester b`.

=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. Double-click the jar file. This will generate some supporting files like preferences.json and config.json.
.. To simulate missing data files, remove any of the generated files. Close the window.
.. Double click the jar file again. +
   Expected: The jar file will automatically generate the relevant files removed.
   These files contain default values and not custom values set by the user.

.. To simulate corrupted data files, edit any of the generated files to break the format.
   The files are in json format and are easily editable. One example edit is to add "BobBuilder" like in the image below.
.. Expected: The jar file will automatically regenerate the corrupted files.
   These files contain default values and not custom values set by the user.

=== Suggesting modules

. Suggesting modules for a specific year and semester
.. Test case: `suggest y/1 s/1` +
   Expected: The panel for *Modules Suggested* is updated to show *Year 1 | Semester 1* and list of suggested modules for year 1 semester 1. A success message is shown in the status message.
.. Test case: `suggest` +
   Expected: The panel for *Modules Suggested* remained the same as before executing the command. Error message is shown in the status message.
.. Other incorrect suggest commands to try: `suggest y/a s/b` (where a is not an integer between 1 to 4 inclusive or b is neither 1 or 2) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Listing modules

. Listing modules for all years
.. Prerequisites: Add some modules to ModulePlanner using `add` command.
.. Test case: `list` +
   Expected: The panel for *Modules Taken* is updated to show *All years* and list of all modules that have been added. A success message is shown in the status message.
.. Test case: `list 1` +
   Expected: The panel for *Modules Taken* remained the same as before executing the command. Error message is shown in the status message.

. Listing modules for a year
.. Prerequisites: Add some modules to year 1 using `add` command.
.. Test case: `list y/1` +
   Expected: The panel for *Modules Taken* is updated to show *Year 1* and all modules that have been added to year 1. A success message is shown in the status message.
.. Test case: `list y/0` +
   Expected: The panel for *Modules Taken* remained the same as before executing the command. Error message is shown in the status message.
.. Other incorrect list commands to try: `list y/a` (where a is not an integer between 1 to 4) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
