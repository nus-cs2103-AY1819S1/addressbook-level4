By: `T10-3`      Since: `Oct 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/storage/XmlAdaptedWord.java[`XmlAdaptedWord.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.learnvocabulary.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteWord.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `LearnVocabularyChangedEvent` when LearnVocabulary's data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteWordEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `WordListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `LearnVocabularyParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a word) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteWordSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the LearnVocabulary data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Word>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/learnvocabulary/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the LearnVocabulary data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.learnvocabulary.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedLearnVocabulary`.
It extends `LearnVocabulary` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `learnVocabularyStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedLearnVocabulary#commit()` -- Saves the current learnvocabulary state in its history.
* `VersionedLearnVocabulary#undo()` -- Restores the previous learnvocabulary state from its history.
* `VersionedLearnVocabulary#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone learnvocabulary state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitLearnVocabulary()`, `Model#undoLearnVocabulary()` and `Model#redoLearnVocabulary()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedLearnVocabulary` will be initialized with the initial learnvocabulary state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single learnvocabulary state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the learnvocabulary. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitLearnVocabulary()`, causing the modified state of the learnvocabulary after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `learnVocabularyStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted learnvocabulary state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitLearnVocabulary()`, causing another modified learnvocabulary state to be saved into the `learnVocabularyStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitLearnVocabulary()`, so the learnvocabulary state will not be saved into the `learnVocabularyStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoLearnVocabulary()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous learnvocabulary state, and restores the learnvocabulary to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial learnvocabulary state, then there are no previous learnvocabulary states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoLearnVocabulary()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoLearnVocabulary()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the learnvocabulary to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `learnVocabularyStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest learnvocabulary state, then there are no undone learnvocabulary states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoLearnVocabulary()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the learnvocabulary, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitLearnVocabulary()`, `Model#undoLearnVocabulary()` or `Model#redoLearnVocabulary()`. Thus, the `learnVocabularyStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitLearnVocabulary()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `learnVocabularyStateList`, all learnvocabulary states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire learnvocabulary.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of learnvocabulary states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedLearnVocabulary`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::learn[]
=== Learn feature
==== Current Implementation

The learn mechanism is facilitated by the `Dictionary` class.
The backbone of LearnVocabulary would have to be the `Learn` command, because it allows the user to query words from the internet and parse their meanings into readable format for storage.
The learn command is indicated as `Learn` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It enables the user to "learn" a word from the world wide web.
This command is requires the use of Internet, should there be an absence of Internet connection, it has already been taken care of via throwing an Exception.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Dictionary#invoke()` -- calls the main function of Dictionary which links it to LearnVocabulary
* `Dictionary#isConnectedToInternet()` -- checks to see if there is an Internet connection established.
* `Dictionary#isWordInOnlineDictionary(Word)` -- checks to see if it is a valid word and if it exists in Dictionary.com
* `Dictionary#convertWord(Word)` -- converts word into first letter is in big caps, whilst the others are in small caps.
* `Dictionary#isValidWord(Word)` -- checks to see if it word contains any illegal characters.

`Dictionary#invoke()` is exposed in the `LearnCommandParser` class as `LearnCommandParser#parse()`, while all the other operations are self-contained within the `Dictionary#invoke()` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the learn mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The user types in `learn magic` into the CLI.

Step 2. `learn magic` will be parsed by LearnVocabularyParser, where the `learn` command will be triggered, calling `LearnCommandParser#parse()`.

Step 3. This in turn calls `Dictionary` class and all of its relevant operations, starting with `Dictionary#invoke()`.

Step 4. The word `magic` will be checked against the model and the current LearnVocabulary to see if they hold the same exact word.

Step 4a. The word does not exist and will be stored, together with the meaning that was queried as a result of `Dictionary#invoke()`.

Step 4b. The word already exists and the command will throw a Duplicate Word Exception.

[NOTE]
The newly queried word would be attached with a "toLearn" tag, which allows the user to know that he/she just queried the word and can leave it for the future to learn it.

Step 5. The word, meaning will be assigned a default tag and be displayed in the Command Box.

The following sequence diagram shows how the learn command works:

image::LearnSequenceDiagram.png[width="820"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How Words are queried in Dictionary
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Online querying of every word being learned.
** Pros: Easy to implement and change (in the future) to accommodate extra meanings.
** Cons: Requires the use of Internet Connection.
* **Alternative 2:** Offline querying of every word being learned.
** Pros: Does not require Internet to query word.
** Cons: Untested, but a corrupt xml file would be disastrous causing corrupt findings, memory space will be an issue as well.

===== Aspect: How Words are stored in Dictionary
* **Alternative 1** (current choice): Offline storage of every word being learned.
** Pros: Easy to implement and does not require the use of a cloud storage.
** Cons: Not mobile and accessible to the user
* **Alternative 2:** Online storage of every word being learned.
** Pros: Mobile access by the user on the go.
** Cons: Will consume a lot of resources. Might not be necessary.

==== Rejected/Put off implementations
===== Idea: Multiple words to be learned at the same time
* `learn fire ice` will simultaneously pull data of 2 words `fire` and `ice` into LearnVocabulary
* This was put off in terms of implementations because:
** Firstly, loading speed will be slow, affecting performance
** Secondly, it causes the command box to freeze

A simple fix was thought of, which was to run threads in LearnVocabulary to pull data simultaneously to reduce time and improve overall performance. That will be explored in later versions.

===== Idea: Synonyms of the same word to be learned at the same time
* `learn hot 10` will simultaneously pull data of hot and 10 of its synonyms. Effectively querying and storing 11 words in total.
* This was rejected terms of implementations because:
** Firstly, it does not serve the intended target audience well. Words can be fetched at random without bearing resemblance to the original queried word.
** Secondly, Speed and performance issue as mentioned in the first idea.

A simple fix for the speed and performance issue was mentioned above.

// end::learn[]

// tag::group[]
=== Group features
==== Current Implementation
The group feature is mainly for user to manage their word lists inside our LearnVocabulary application and it now supports three functionalitys, which are groupadd, groupdelete, and showgroup.

===== groupadd functionality implementation
Similar to the other existed functionalities, the groupadd functionality mainly consists of a GroupaddCommandParser and a GroupaddCommand.
The groupadd parser is indicated as `GroupaddCommand` in `parser`, and inherits the `Parser` class. It enables the application to handle the input given by the the user, check its validity and delete whitespaces.
The groupadd command is indicated as `Groupadd` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It handles a valid group name input and enables the user to "add" a empty word group to the application.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the groupadd functionality behaves at each step.

Step 1: User calls “groupadd + [groupname]” where `groupname` is the name of the newly added group.

Step 2: `GroupAddCommandParser` checks the validity of the groupname, trim the given groupname and create the GroupaddCommand.

Step 3a: If the user set a group name that has already existed, the system throws an exception to the user to indicate that the group name has existed.

Step 3b: Otherwise it lets the model component to add the group with given groupname.

image::groupaddSequentialDiagram.jpg[width="820"]

===== groupdelete functionality implementation
Similar to the other existed functionalities, the groupdelete functionality mainly consists of a GroupDeleteCommandParser and a GroupdeleteCommand.
The groupdelete parser is indicated as `GroupDeleteCommand` in `parser`, and inherits the `Parser` class. It enables the application to handle the input given by the the user.
The groupdelete command is indicated as `Groupdelete` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It handles a valid group name input and enables the user to "delete" a word group and all the words inside.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the groupdelete functionality behaves at each step.

Step 1: User calls “groupdelete + [groupname]” where `groupname` is the name of the desired deleted group.

Step 2: `GroupDeleteCommandParser` checks the validity of the groupname, trim the given groupname and create the GroupdeleteCommand.

Step 3: `GroupDeleteCommand` checks passed arguments.

Step 4a: If the user set a group name that does not exist, the system throw an exception to indicate that the desired deleted group does not exist.

step 4b: Otherwise it lets the model component to delete the group with given groupname. Especially, for those words which exist in this only deleted group, those words would also be deleted automately.

image::groupdeleteSequentialDiagram.jpg[width="820"]

===== showgroup functionality implementation
Similar to the other existed functionalities, the showgroup functionality mainly consists of a ShowGroupCommandParser and a ShowGroupCommand.
The showgroup parser is indicated as `ShowGroupCommand` in `parser`, and inherits the `Parser` class. It enables the application to handle the input given by the the user.
The showgroup command is indicated as `ShowGroup` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It handles a valid group name input and enables the user to either see all the existing groups or open a selected word group and see all the words inside.

Given below are two example usage scenarios and how the showgroup functionality behaves at each step.

====== Example a

Step 1: User calls “showgroup + [groupname]” where `groupname` is the name of the desired checked group.

Step 2: `ShowGroupCommandParser` checks the validity of the groupname, trims the given groupname and create the ShowGroupCommand.

Step 3: `ShowgroupCommand` checks passed arguments.

Step 4a: If the user set a group name that does not exist, the system throw an exception to indicate that the desired checked group does not exist.

Step 4b: Otherwise it lets the model component to update the groupname as the predicate in the filterList.

image::showgroupSequentialDiagram2.jpg[width="820"]

====== Example b

Step 1: User calls “showgroup”.

Step 2: `ShowGroupCommandParser` creates the ShowGroupCommand.

Step 3: `ShowGroupCommand` gets all the existing groupname from the model by calling getTags() and show these groupnames to the user.

image::showgroupSequentialDiagram1.jpg[width="820"]

// end::group[]

// tag::basic[]
=== Basic features
==== Current Implementation
Improved from the previous versions, the `Add` and `Edit` commands have been refined in LearnVocabulary.
There is also a minor feature added `Show`, which displays a filtered word list on the Ui.

[NOTE]
Each tag being added follows AB4's implementation, separate tags are considered via `t/` +
So, `t/happy`, `t/emotions`, `t/sad` is considered 3 tags and they MUST have already been added via `groupadd`.
Tags will not be added as a whole if any of them do not exist.

===== Add command improvements
When adding a new word to LearnVocabulary, only the `Name` and `Meaning` fields must be entered as follows: `add n/fire m/something hot`.
As can be seen from the example given, there is no `Tag` being entered at all. However, LearnVocabulary will enforce that every word would
require at least one tag. As such, the default tag "toLearn" will be given to words without any tags at the start.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types in `add n/fire m/something hot` into the CLI.

Step 2. `add n/fire m/something hot` will be parsed by LearnVocabularyParser, where the `add` command will be triggered, calling `AddCommandParser#parse()`.

Step 3a. Illegal characters will cause the command to throw an exception and await a new command.

Step 3b. Word with letters being parsed will be checked against LearnVocabulary to ensure no duplicate words.

Step 4. Word will have a default tag attached, be added to LearnVocabulary after ensuring no duplicates.

===== Edit command improvements
When editing an existing word in LearnVocabulary, there cannot be empty tags for any words provided.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types in `edit 1 t/` which shows the user wanting to clear all tags from existing word.

Step 2. The command box outputs that it is not possible, at least one tag must be attached to the word.

===== Show feature
The `show` command is an improvement in leaps and bounds ahead of the `find` command, but it exists as a separate command on its own due to its nature.
Simply put, when entering `show fire magic life`, it will display the 3 words on the Ui and automatically outputs
the word, meaning and tags onto the Command Box. The first word from the list will also be automatically selected.

As such, `Show` was implemented with a more Ui state of mind, to ensure the user's ease of use when finding the words for display of their meanings as AddressBook level 4 did not cater to this particular arrangement.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the show mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types in `show fire magic life`, it will display the 3 words in order as it was in the list.

[NOTE]
Multiple words are allowed to be queried. Allows for more flexibility compared to the Ui option.

Step 2. From the filtered list of words, the program automatically selects and displays first word from list.

Step 3. The 3 words will appear in the Command Box as well.

// end::basic[]

// tag::trivia[]
=== Trivia feature

The trivia function is facilitated by `LearnVocabulary`.
Besides storing a `UniqueWordList`, `LearnVocabulary` also stores the current trivia question as `triviaQuestion` and stores a list of trivia questions is `triviaQuestionList`.
Scores for a trivia game are also stored using `currentScore` and `maxScore`.

Additionally, it also implements the following operations:

* `setTriviaList` -- sets the trivia question list based on the current vocabulary list
* `setTrivia` -- sets the trivia question based on `triviaQuestionList`
* `getTrivia` -- outputs the current trivia question.
* `updateScore` -- adds 1 to the the`currentScore`
* `clearTrivia` -- clears the current trivia question as well as removing it from the `triviaQuestionList`
* `isTriviaMode` -- a boolean to indicate whether the model is currently in trivia mode.
* `toggleTriviaMode` -- toggle trivia mode

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model.setTrivia()` and `Model.getTrivia()`.


Outlined below is how the trivia function operates at each step:

Step 1. The user inputs trivia in the CLI.

Step 2. `TriviaCommand.execute()` checks `lastShownList` to see if it is empty.

[NOTE]
If `lastShownList` is empty, `TriviaCommand.execute()` will terminate and a message will be displayed to the user indicating that the user has to add words in before `trivia` can be used

Step 3. `TriviaCommand.execute()` calls `toggleTriviaMode` to indicate that LearnVocabulary is in trivia mode.

[NOTE]
While in trivia mode, every command the user types will be parsed as `TriviaAnsCommand`. Trivia mode can be exited by either completing the trivia or typing "triviaExit"

Step 4. `TriviaCommand.execute()` now calls `Model.setTriviaList()` to set the trivia question within `LearnVocabulary`.

Step 5. `TriviaCommand.execute()` calls `Model.getTrivia()` and outputs to the user.

Below shows a sequence diagram of how the trivia feature works.

image::TriviaSequenceDiagram.png[width="820"]

**Answer**

The answer command is indicated as `TriviaAnsCommand` in `commands`. It will take in arguments passed in by the user and checks whether it is the correct/wrong answer to the current trivia question.

Outlined below is how the answer function operates:

Step 1: User enters  his/her argument.

[NOTE]
Attempting to call the `answer` command without first calling `trivia` will result in an error.

Step 2: `TriviaAnsCommandParser` processes the argument and parses it to `TriviaAnsCommand`.

[NOTE]
If the user inputs `triviaExit` or `triviaShow`, the inputs will be processed as commands instead.

Step 3: `TriviaAnsCommand.execute()` checks the passed argument is the same word as `triviaQuestion` in `LearnVocabulary`.

Step 4: Outputs a correct or wrong message based on the result in step 3.

Below shows a sequence diagram of how the answer feature works.

**Select**

The select command is indicated as `SelectCommand` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It selects a word identified by a user using its index from the review list.

Below is a description on how the select function operates:

Step 1: User calls “select + [index]” where `index` is the index of the word that the user wants to select.

Step 2: `SelectCommand` checks passed arguments.

Step 3: If the user leaves out or in other ways enters an invalid index, `SelectCommand` throws an exception. Otherwise it returns the desired word.

=== WordOfTheDay feature
==== Current Implementation

The Word Of The Day command is indicated as `WordOfTheDay` in `commands`, and inherits the `Command` class. It enables the user to display the current word of the day taken from website Dictionary.com. Similarly to the "learn" command, this command also requires a working internet connection. It is impossible to make this feature available offline since the word of the day cannot be predicted on Dictionary.com

The Word Of The Day command utilizes the same functions in the Dictionary class made for the 'LearnCommand', but also adds the following functions:

* `Dictionary#doesWordOfTheDayExist()` -- Checks to see if the word of the day exist on Dictionary.com and returns the word of the day page as a Document object.
* `Dictionary#fetchWordOfTheDay()` -- Parses the word of the day and its meaning from the Document object returned by `doesWordOfTheDayExist()` and returns itself (Dictionary object).

Dictionary#fetchWordOfTheDay() is used in the WordOfTheDayParser class as WordOfTheDayParser#parse(), while all the other executions are self-contained within the Dictionary#fetchWordOfTheDay() function.

Below is a description on how the Word Of The Day function operates:

Step 1: User cannot think of a word so he/she wants to display the word of the day on Dictionary.com.

Step 2: User would make sure that there is a working internet connection.

Step 3: User would type "word" into the command line.

Step 4: The word of the day will be parsed by WordOfTheDayParser, calling `WordOfTheDayParser#parse()` The WordOfTheDayParser exists solely for the purpose of utilizing the existing functions made for parsing the online Dictionary and putting the word into a `Word` object.

Step 5: This calls the `Dictionary` class and all relevant functions. The first one being `Dictionary#fetchWordOfTheDay()`.

Step 6: The Word Of The Day will be fetched online from Dictionary.com and displayed by the WordOfTheDayCommand together with its meaning. Should the internet-connection fail, the operation throws a `MESSAGE_NO_INTERNET`.


[NOTE]
The Word Of The Day is displayed together with a "WordOfTheDay" tag. The word and the tag are not stored in any group somewhere, but is only displayed for the user. If the user wants to learn the word, he or she shall use the LearnCommand.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Word Of The Day command works:

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.learnvocabulary.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.learnvocabulary.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.learnvocabulary.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.learnvocabulary.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, LearnVocabulary depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
