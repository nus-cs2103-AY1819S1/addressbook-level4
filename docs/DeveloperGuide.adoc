By: `Team Concierge(TM)`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[NOTE] The diagrams in this section are intended to be updated only in v.1.5.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ConciergeChangedEvent` when Concierge data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::NewLogicComponentClassDiagram.png[width="960"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ConciergeParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a guest) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores Concierge data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Guest>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Concierge`, which `Guest` can reference. This would allow `Concierge` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Guest` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. Only UniqueGuestList is shown for simplicity. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save Concierge data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

[NOTE]
Diagrammatic references to "AddressBook" are intended to be removed in v.1.5.
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedConcierge`.
It extends `Concierge` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `conciergeStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedConcierge#commit()` -- Saves the current Concierge state in its history.
* `VersionedConcierge#undo()` -- Restores the previous Concierge state from its history.
* `VersionedConcierge#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone Concierge state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitConcierge()`, `Model#undoConcierge()` and `Model#redoConcierge()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedConcierge` will be initialized with the initial Concierge state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single Concierge state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th guest in Concierge. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitConcierge()`, causing the modified state of Concierge after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `conciergeStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Concierge state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new guest. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitConcierge()`, causing another modified Concierge state to be saved into the `conciergeStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitConcierge()`, so Concierge state will not be saved into the `conciergeStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the guest was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoConcierge()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Concierge state, and restores Concierge to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Concierge state, then there are no previous Concierge states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoConcierge()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoConcierge()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores Concierge to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `conciergeStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Concierge state, then there are no undone Concierge states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoConcierge()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify Concierge, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitConcierge()`, `Model#undoConcierge()` or `Model#redoConcierge()`. Thus, the `conciergeStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitConcierge()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `conciergeStateList`, all Concierge states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Concierge.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the guest being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of Concierge states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedConcierge`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::add[]
=== Adding a Booking

The `add` command is used by the receptionist to add the guest to the hotel,
and assign him a room.

==== Current Implementation
We currently accept a `Guest`, `RoomNumber` and `BookingPeriod`
as parameters for the `AddCommand` constructor. An example of its usage:
`add n/Madith p/83141592 e/madith@themyth.com r/041 from/29/11/2018 to/ 03/12/2018`

The parsing of the `AddCommand` is very similar to what was already
implemented in AddressBook4. More parameters were added, namely the
`RoomNumber` and `BookingPeriod`. These are parsed to create the respective
objects - `Guest`, `RoomNumber` and `BookingPeriod`.

* In v2.0, users can enter a start date and duration to specify their booking
period.

As in AddressBook4, the `Logic` component parses the `AddCommand`, and the
`Model` handles its execution.

* In the `Model`, the `Guest` is _no longer_ added to Concierge. It was
previously the case in AddressBook4.
* A new `Booking` object is created with the `Guest` and `BookingPeriod` as
its parameters.
* This `Booking` is then added to the `Room` with the `RoomNumber` specified. Every `Room` maintains a `SortedSet<Booking>` which is encapsulated in the
 `Bookings` (plural) class.

An Activity Diagram for the execution of `AddCommand#execute` is shown below.

image::AddCommand-activity-diagram.png[width="400"]

[NOTE]
The `AddCommandParser` already checks that `ROOM_NUMBER` is a valid
string from `001` to `100`, and the initialisation of Concierge checks that
there are 100 rooms. The `RoomNotFoundException` is not expected to occur
for any user input, but is left there as a defensive measure.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Check for outdated bookings

Outdated bookings are those which have a start date before today. Concierge
disallows users to `add` outdated bookings.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Do the check in `AddCommand#execute`
** Pros: Very easy to implement. A parameter check in the `execute` method will
suffice. Will only affect the `AddCommandSystemTest`.
** Cons: The actual `Model#addBooking` does not do any check on the
`BookingPeriod` being outdated, opening the possibly of outdated `Booking` s
being added from via other commands.

* **Alternative 2:** Do the check in `Room#addBooking`
** Pros: Centralises exceptions thrown related to bookings in the
`Booking` class. Increases the cohesiveness of this class.
** Cons: All the existing tests and sample data calling the `addBooking`
method with outdated bookings have to be changed. It also becomes difficult
to do unit tests on checking in bookings which are outdated but not expired,
since these bookings can no longer be added to the model.

===== Aspect: Reduce coupling between `Room` and `Guest`

Semantically, we can observe a strong coupling and dependency between `Room`
and `Guest`. A `Room` contains a `Guest`, and a `Guest` also has a `Room`.
Maintaining this coupling allows for very quick lookup both ways, either
given a `Guest` (which is common at the reception desk) or given a `Room`
(which is common for housekeeping).

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add `Guest` as a field in `Room`
** Pros: An efficient way for managing bookings. Receptionist can quickly
determine if the `Room` is free to book. Lookup time for `Guest` not
expected to increase greatly, since `Room` s are not expected to have a large
 number of advanced bookings made.
** Cons: Difficult to find the `Room` given the `Guest`. When a `Guest` has made
an advanced booking and wishes to cancel it, we have to search through all
the `Room` s. Nevertheless, we expect most guests to be aware of their rooms.

* **Alternative 2:** Add `Room` as a field in `Guest`
** Pros: Very customer-centric design. Centralises all the information about
the `Guest`, including `Booking` s made and `Expense` s incurred.
** Cons: Making a new `Booking` with a `Guest` is highly inefficient.
`Booking` information is now scattered across individual `Guest` s.
*** [v1.4] On top of the list of rooms, we maintain a separate list of
checked-in guests. This list does not retain any booking information, as it
 is meant to for a quick lookup of the guests' particulars.
// end::add[]

// tag::list[]
=== Rooms List Feature
The rooms list feature builds upon, and reuses functions from the ;originally implemented ListCommand.

The Activity UML Diagram for the current implementation of ListCommand is as follows:

image::ListCommandUml.png[width="400"]

==== Current Implementation
The list function is facilitated by a modified `ListCommand` class, of which the input from the CommandBox is parsed by a `ListCommandParser` class.

The list function now requires a flag after the 'list' command. Below are the two allowed list commands:

* `list -g` - Lists all guests.
* `list -cg` - Lists all checked-in guests.
* `list -r` - Lists all rooms.

A `ListCommandParser` class was created to obtain and compare the flags from inputs, which required a different approach to the rest of the commands. The input string is simply split using a String function, obtaining an array of strings, of which the flags will be at index 1.

Modification of existing FXML files, and creation of new FXML files was done to achieve separate listing of guests and rooms, and the browser panel was replaced with a panel to focus on, and display more detailed information on the selected guest/room.

In order to stack the UI elements on top of one another to reuse and display the separate lists under the same column, modifications were made to the `MainWindow.fxml` file.
The GuestListPanel and RoomListPanel each has a "VBox" element encapsulating them, which visibility is toggled and the element itself enabled or disabled based on the flag that was obtained from the parser. This feature extends to the GuestDetailedPanel and RoomDetailedPanel and is achieved in the same way.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to display each list
* **Alternative 1 :** Maintain two columns on the MainWindow UI to display both rooms and guests
** Pros: Easier to modify UI by adding on instead of modifying and replacing, and modifications in the future will not be too tedious.
** Cons: UI looks cluttered with an empty column when not displaying the other, not an efficient use of screen space.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Separately display the two lists within the same MainWindow UI space/column.
** Pros: Cleaner looking, fully utilises empty spaces. Better visual feedback from commands as inputs.
** Cons: Requires heavy modification of MainWindow UI files, future features must stick with the restriction of having a list of either guests or rooms.
// end::list[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find Feature
The Find feature expands upon the originally implemented FindCommand, allowing for the searching of both rooms and guests, with several filters.

The Activity UML Diagram for the current implementation of FindCommand is as follows:

image::FindCommandUml.png[width="400"]

==== Current Implementation
The find function is facilitated by a modified `FindCommand` class, of which the input from the CommandBox is parsed by a `FindCommandParser` class.

The find function now has the ability to find either guests or rooms. The starting commands for the find function with flags are as follows:

* `find -g` - Find guests.
* `find -cg` - Find checked-in guests.
* `find -r` - Find rooms.

The above command must be followed up by at least 1 filter, and they are as follows:

Guest Filters (-g):

* `n/ - Name`
* `p/ - Phone Number`
* `e/ - Email Address`
* `t/ - Tags`

Room Filters (-r):

* `r/ - Room Number`
* `c/ - Capacity`
* `t/ - Room Tags`
* `n/ - Name of guest with bookings`

The following are filters for room bookings. The flags cannot be mixed.
The flags can be used independently, or with a from/to specified date.
Input dates must be in DD/MM/YY format.

* `-hb - Has Bookings Flag`
* `-nb - No Bookings Flag`
* `from/ - Booking Start Date`
* `to/ - Booking End Date`

The FindCommandParser uses a tokenizer to obtain the individual arguments/filters, whether the filter is present or not. If a filter is present, the input that precedes the filter prefix will be used to create the individual predicate class.

These predicate classes are collected into a list of predicates before they are combined and merged in the FindCommand class. The combined final predicate is then passed to the Model Manager to filter the guest/room list, and a listingChangedEvent is called to update the UI elements.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: OR/AND Searching
When searching, a few things have to be considered. Does the filter specified have an OR relationship with one another, or an AND relationship.
An example is this: find -g n/Alex t/VIP, this can be interpreted in two ways. Finding guests with name as "Alex" AND with tag "VIP", or name "Alex" or tag "VIP.
// end::find[]

// tag::checkin[]
=== Room Check-in/Checkout feature
==== Current Implementation

The room check-in and checkout features makes use of `UniqueRoomList`.
The logic that supports the check-in and checkout operations mainly reside in the `Concierge` and `Room` classes.

* `UniqueRoomList#checkin(RoomNumber)` -- Checks in the first booking of the room identified by the given room number
* `UniqueRoomList#checkout(RoomNumber)` -- Checks out the first booking of the room identified by the given room number
* `UniqueRoomList#checkout(RoomNumber, LocalDate)` -- Checks out the room's booking whose start date matches the given date

[NOTE]
Active booking refers to a booking that includes today's date. +
First booking refers to the earliest (i.e. first in chronological order).
[NOTE]
A room can be checked out regardless of its checked-in status. Thus, `checkout` doubles as a command to delete bookings.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#checkInRoom` and `Model#checkoutRoom` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and the flow of the check-in feature.

Assuming there is a booking already added to room 001,

* The user executes `checkin r/001` when the guest arrives.
. The `checkin` command takes in a `RoomNumber` argument and calls `Model#checkInRoom` as such: `Model.checkInRoom(roomNumber)`
. `ModelManager#checkInRoom` (which implements Model) will call `VersionedConcierge#checkInRoom`
. `VersionedConcierge#checkInRoom` will call `UniqueRoomList#getRoom` to get the room using its RoomNumber
. `VersionedConcierge#checkInRoom` will call `Room#checkIn`
. `Room#checkIn` will
.. throw `NoBookingException` if the room has no bookings
.. throw `ExpiredBookingException` if the room's first booking is expired
.. throw `InactiveBookingCheckInException` if the room's first booking is not active
.. throw `BookingAlreadyCheckedInException` if the room's first booking is already checked in
.. update the first booking as checked-in if no exceptions were thrown, and replace the room with its updated version that has the first booking checked-in
. `VersionedConcierge#checkinRoom` will call `VersionedConcierge#addCheckedInGuestIfNotPresent`
. `VersionedConcierge#addCheckedInGuestIfNotPresent` will add the guest of the checked-in booking to the checked-in guest list
 if he/she is not already in it

The following sequence diagram shows how `CheckInCommand#execute` works, from the Logic up to the Model:

._The sequence diagram of `CheckInCommand#execute`._
image::CheckinCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="1280"]

Since the Model simply calls `VersionedConcierge#checkInRoom`, the following activity diagram will illustrate how
`Concierge#checkInRoom` works:

._The activity diagram of checking-in a room when `Concierge#checkInRoom` is executed._
image::check-in-activity-diagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Immutability of check-in command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `checkIn` a room by creating a new copy of the room
 with the `isCheckedIn` flag of the first booking set to true.
** Pros: Debugging is easy. Consistent with the rest of the application.
** Cons: `checkIn` method becomes unintuitive, since a new room is returned from the operation,
 instead of a void method simply setting the instance property.
* **Alternative 2:** `checkIn` a room by setting the `isCheckedIn` flag of the first booking to true.
** Pros: Check-in method is intuitive, and does not return a new room.
** Cons: Harder to debug. Tests also become troublesome since changes are made to the same referenced room.

===== Aspect: Deletion of bookings

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `checkout` to delete any booking.
** Pros: `checkout` doubles as a delete booking feature, so no need for a `deletebooking` command.
** Cons: Not very natural, as `checkout` implies checking out a checked-in booking.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `checkout` to delete only active booking, and create new command `deletebooking` to delete expired and upcoming bookings.
** Pros: More natural, `checkout` can only do what its name implies.
** Cons: Need to implement new command and more methods, to support the same deletion operation but with a different name.

// tag::expenses[]
=== Expense, Expenses and ExpenseType
In Concierge, users will be given the feature of tracking the expenditure of each individual
guest, in order to facilitate checkout charges. Hence, the three classes, `Expenses`, `Expense`
and `ExpenseType` have been created for this purpose. In addition, the hotel also has a
`Menu` of goods and services available.

==== Current Implementation
`ExpenseType` objects are essentially immutable objects that represent a single item or service
being sold at the hotel. An `ExpenseType` object contains information about its menu number,
usual price, and description. The main purpose of this class is for convenience; users may
charge a customer by simply providing the menu number of the item and the cost and description
of the item will be able to be referenced. `ExpenseType` information is stored in a `Menu`
object, which is then stored on the hard disk, since users should have the ability to modify
the menu manually. The `Menu` object is internally represented with a `HashMap<String, ExpenseType>`,
with the menu number as keys and the `ExpenseType` objects as values.

* **Alternative 1: Use a List<ExpenseType> to store the menu.** While there may be negligible
differences for a small menu, searching for an `ExpenseType` object still takes linear time
and there may be significant performance drops for a large menu.

An `Expense` object contains information about one individual expenditure by a guest. An
`Expense` object encapsulates the cost, `ExpenseType` of the item bought, and the date and time
of expenditure.

The `Expenses` object is essentially a `List<Expense>`. Every room contains an `Expenses`
object, to represent the collection of all the expenses of the guests in the room.

* **Alternative 1: Use a `List<Expense>` object**: Defining the `Expenses` class allows us
to restrict access to the collection, and only allow certain methods such as adding an
`Expense` or displaying on screen.
* **Alternative 2: Use a `Set<Expense>` object**: Having the expenses ordered (e.g.
chronologically) will be useful for generating a nice view of all the expenses incurred.

Here is a simple UML describing the roles of these classes.

image::expense_uml.png[width="600"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Immutability of Menu
While it is conceivable that the items sold may change from time to time,
for various reasons such as unpopularity or seasonal products, giving users
the ability to add and remove items from the menu may result in more
problems than benefits. We expect that alterations to the menu will not be
performed frequently, and that the majority of our users, receptionists,
will not be required to add and remove items to the menu. The menu also does
not have to be altered during operational hours. Hence, by making
`Menu` immutable, we eliminate the possibility of making accidental or
unwarranted changes to the menu. The only method to modify `Menu` would
thus be through the XML file, which we believe is suitable for these
purposes.

===== Aspect: Immutability of ExpenseType
The `ExpenseType` object is meant to hold the default values of the name and
price of each item. In other words, since an `Expense` object references an
`ExpenseType` object, the `Expense` object is allowed to have a cost that
is different from the cost in the corresponding `ExpenseType` object, to
account for cases such as the guest having a personalised discount due to
the usage of vouchers or certain credit cards. Thus, ExpenseType does not
need to be modified by users in the application. Nonetheless, it is still
possible to modify the default information through editing the XML file.

===== Aspect: Assignment of the Expenses object
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Assign `expenses` to each `Room`.
** Pros: Suitable for current architecture. Each `Booking` only has one `Guest`,
   and each `Guest` will only stay in one `Room`. Makes more sense to assign to
   `Room` such that it represents the expenditure of the entire `Room` and not
   one `Guest`, since the occupants of the `Room` can only contribute to one single
   `Expenses` object. `Room` is a more natural choice over `Booking` as `Booking`
   is meant to encapsulate booking information such as timing and `Room`.
   Not much difference in implementation no matter which one of the three classes
   it is assigned to.
** Cons: May be confusing to implement. Need to ensure that there are no expenses
   for rooms that have no guests.
* **Alternative 2:** Assign `expenses` to each `Guest`.
** Pros: Can track `expenses` of each `Guest`, can find out who are the heavy
   spenders. Can use this information for promotional activities such as vouchers
   or membership.
** Cons: Not all guests that will stay in the hotel are registered in the guest
   list, since each `Booking` only requires the name of one `Guest`, regardless of
   the `Room`. Will require a major refactoring of the `add` command. Complications
   may also arise if a `Guest` has multiple bookings simultaneously and there is a
   need to track the `Expenses` over different rooms.
* **Alternative 3:** Assign `expenses` to each `Booking`.
** Pros: Can allow tracking of the booker's expenditure, less confusing to implement
   than `Room`, can allow for expenses to be recorded before the guest checks in.
** Cons: May violate SRP, since `Booking` should ideally only deal with booking
   information.
// end::expenses[]

// tag::money[]
=== Money

==== Current Implementation
`Money` is a class used to store monetary values. This class was created to
enforce the restriction that monetary values should always have at most two
decimal places, which could be inconvenient if using Java data types such
as `double` or `BigDecimal`. `Money` objects can be created by the user
through the `service` command (details in the next section).

The `Money` class contains two main attributes, `dollars` and `cents`, both
of which are `int`s, since it is unlikely that the cost of any one item will
exceed `Integer.MAX_VALUE` dollars.

The main method of creating `Money` objects is through the `service` command,
with the `Money` class parsing a string to convert into a `Money` object.
The method `isValidMoneyFormat()` handles the checking of the string format,
and the list of requirements are as follows:

* Can be negative.
* Format of the string should be {1 to 10 digits}.{2 digits}, e.g. `12.34`.
  `123`, `.50`, `12.9`, `12345612345.00` are not allowed.
* The `dollars` section can be 0 but cannot have leading 0, i.e. 0.12 is allowed
  but 01.23 is not allowed.
* The `dollars` section should not exceed `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
* Cannot have characters that are not digits or `.` or `-`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Immutability of Money
`Money` does not have to be mutable. Adjustment of `Expenses` are to be done
through the `service` command. `Money` is simply a data type, much like
`Double` and `Integer`.
// end::money[]

// tag::service[]
=== ServiceCommand

==== Current Implementation
The `service` command is used for charging expenses to rooms. This
functionality is the main reason that the classes Expenses, Expense,
ExpenseType, Menu and Money were implemented. The format for the `service`
command is as such:

`service r/ROOM_NUMBER no/ITEM_NUMBER [c/COST]`

The cost is made optional for the convenience of the user. We expect that
most of the time, the cost of items are more or less fixed. Instead of
having the user type in the same cost all of the time, the field is made
optional. This functionality is enabled by the use of `ExpenseType` and
`Menu`, which stores the default cost of items. If the cost is not specified,
the default cost of the item will be used.

As in AddressBook4, the ConciergeParser (aka AddressBookParser) will parse
the user input and create a `ServiceCommandParser` object to parse a `service`
command. The `ServiceCommandParser` is responsible for checking that the
`RoomNumber` and cost (a `Money` object) are in the correct format. Note that
the item number is not checked here, since the `Menu` object of `Concierge`
has to be available in order to check that the given item number is a valid
item. Hence, any string will be accepted by the parser. Since `ServiceCommand`
has access to the `Model` and thus the `Menu`, the checking is given to
`ServiceCommand` instead. A successful parse will then return a
`ServiceCommand(RoomNumber roomNumber, String itemNumber, Optional<Money> itemCost)`
object.

The following flowchart describes what happens when the `execute` method
of a `ServiceCommand` is called.

image::ServiceCommand-flowchart.png[width="600"]

The `model.addExpense()` method call was not illustrated in detail in the flowchart,
thus it is illustrated in this sequence diagram.

image::AddExpenseSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Deleting and editing Expenses
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `service` to edit `Expense`s.
** Pros: Simply keying in `Expense`s with negative values is easy to implement,
   and does not stray far from real-life implementations, e.g. receipts often
   contain cost subtractions for discounts and promotions.
** Cons: May not be elegant, `Expenses` may become cluttered if there's too many
   corrections.
* **Alternative 2:** Create new commands to edit and delete `Expense`s.
** Pros: The `Expenses` will contain all the `Expense`s at their correct prices.
** Cons: More effort to implement, difficult to implement, e.g. may need to implement
   listing out all `Expense`s of a `Room` with the `list` command in order to select
   the `Expense` to delete or edit. Information on discounts and corrections will
   also be lost.

// end::service[]

// tag::loginlogout[]
=== Login and Logout

The `login` feature allows hotel managers to control which receptionists
have full access to Concierge. When paired with the CommandArchive feature,
they can also create a blame history to trace rogue commands.

==== Current Implementation

Currently, `login` is implemented as a
<<Aspect: Accessing features of Concierge with/ without login, dynamic feature>>,
so users are not prompted to sign in upon starting Concierge. Instead, they
only have to sign in when executing commands which would mutate the data,
such as `add`, `checkin`, `checkout`, `reassign`, `service` and `clear`.

===== Logic

Given the nature of the `login` command being dynamic (can be entered at any
point in time, between any commands), it is then natural to implement it like
a normal command, extending the abstract `Command` class. The `logout` command
 is also implemented in this way.

===== Model

The model handles the signing-in, using its attribute `LogInManager`.
 The Class Diagram of the login module is shown below.

image::LogInCommand-LogInManager-classdiagram.png[width=700]

`LogInManager` uses an optional `username` to keep track of whether
the user is currently signed in. The `passwordReferenceList` provides an
immutable key-value lookup for usernames and passwords. +

`LogInManager` implements the following operations.

* `LogInManager#isSignedIn()` - checks if the user is currently signed in.
* `LogInManager#signIn(String, String)` - attempts to sign in with the given
username and hashed password. This is handled by the `PasswordHashList`. A
case-insensitive comparison is used on the hash.
* `LogInManager#signOut()` - signs out of Concierge.

A new method `resetUndoRedoHistory` was added to the
`VersionedConcierge` (used for the Undo/ Redo feature). This is used to clear
the command history upon a `logout` command, so users cannot undo important
commands or redo accidental bad commands after signing out.

====== Login

Shown below is the Sequence Diagram for executing a valid `login` command.
The diagram also illustrates how the `LogicManager` checks for the sign-in
requirement of commands.

image::LogInCommand-sequencediagram.png[width=1000]

===== Storage

The `passwords.json` file is read when Concierge is first opened (i.e. in
`MainApp#init`), and is never written to again. The storage function is
managed by the `JsonPasswordsStorage` class. Intuitively, passwords are stored as
<<Aspect: Storage of Passwords, key-value pairs>> for quick look-up.

A SHA-256 hash was used in building this feature. In future, this hashing
algorithm can be changed to a HMAC hash, which adds a username salt. Then,
different users will not know if they have chosen the same passwords.

===== Check for sign-in requirement of commands

`LogicManager` does the
<<Aspect: Check for sign-in requirement of commands, checks for whether a command requires a sign in>>,
 and whether the model is signed in.

The `Command` class exposes a new `requiresSignIn()` method that returns
false by default. To make new command require signing-in, one only has to
overwrite this method in that command.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Accessing features of Concierge with/ without login

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Login is needed only for some features
** Pros: Manager can implement some level of access control within Concierge,
 especially since some of the more commonly used Concierge features (`list`,
 `find`) are read-only features. This is quicker than mandating a sign-in at
 the start and creating different user views based on the account privilege (admin vs normal).
** Cons: Not very intuitive to users. They have to enter commands before being
told they need to sign in. The `requiresSignIn()` check takes place after the
parsing of the command, so a user can is told they cannot execute the command
without a sign-in after their command is parsed correctly.

* **Alternative 2:** Login is needed for all features
** Pros: Very easy to check login validity. This only occurs when Concierge is
first loaded. Subsequent commands can be executed without additional checks
on the sign-in requirement.

===== Aspect: Check for sign-in requirement of commands

Given that sign-in is only required for some commands, the priority in
designing this aspect is the ability to easily mandate/ disable compulsory
the login requirement for current and future commands.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Do the check in `LogInManager#execute`
** Pros: Ensures that commands are checked before any execution. Users will not
inadvertently change the model before doing the sign-in checks.
** Cons: Unable to implement commands that can do some actions without
sign-in. For example, a future developer may want to make the `add` command
such that when the user is not signed-in, the booking is still added but a tag
 is added to the `Guest`, reminding the manager to verify the booking.
*** Violates the Single Responsibility Principle. The job of `LogicManager`
is to parse and execute commands.

* **Alternative 2:** Do the check in `Command#execute`
** Pros: Increases cohesiveness of `Command` class. The compulsory sign-in is
 an attribute of a `Command`, so these checks can be done internally.
 `Command` can implement a method `checkSignIn(Model)`, and commands which
 require sign-ins can call this method in their respective `execute` methods.
** Cons: While increasing cohesion, this implementation makes less semantic sense.
 The logical misstep comes because one is executing the method, then checking
  if the method can be executed, then "reversing" the execution.

===== Aspect: Storage of Passwords

The password file is currently read at `MainApp#init`, and saved once.
Unlike the Concierge data, this file is no longer referred to when Concierge
is in use.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store passwords in JSON file
** Pros: JSON is very easy to work with.
*** Able to utilise existing `JsonUtil` methods used by the `UserPrefs` and
`Config` classes.
*** Easily parse data into key-value pairs, which semantically matches our needs.
** Cons: `JsonUtil` file is not completely suitable for a data type that has
potentially an unlimited number of entries, since this utility serialises the
 data to match the class attributes.
* **Alternative 2:** Store passwords in same XML file as all other
Concierge data
** Pros: Centralises data storage in Concierge. There is only one single
source of truth for all data.
** Cons: The XML file is too complicated for the needs of password storage.
*** Concierge does not need to write the the passwords file when in use.
`concierge.xml` is constantly being written to, which is an unnecessary and
possibly unsafe feature for the passwords component.
*** Creating a new password entry is difficult since once has to add all
the layers of XML tags involved. Nevertheless, users are not expected to be
adding new accounts on a regular basis.
// end::loginlogout[]

// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete: kbd:[Ctrl], kbd:[Alt]

==== Overview

The Autocomplete feature allows the user to seamlessly type in the
full command and prefixes without having to worry if he/she missed
out on any prefix. This feature helps the user by prompting the correct
format. This is useful as some of the commands require several inputs
from the user and hence this will save time and commands can be
executed faster.

A quick-clear has also been added as part of this feature, so that
the user can again, save time.Press kbd:[Alt] to quick-clear the
`CommandBox` (saves time for user when he wants to clear the box).

The command box before kbd:[Alt] is pressed:

image::servicepreclear.png[width="419"]

The command box aft kbd:[Alt] is pressed:

image::servicepostclear.png[width="371"]

==== Example of how feature works

**Step 1**: Launch application

**Step 2**: User enters `a` in `CommandBox` then presses kbd:[Ctrl].
`AutoCompleteManager()` compares `input` through the list of
`initCommandKeyWords`and proceeds to display the command in the
`CommandBox` because `a` is an applicable `COMMAND_WORD`.

image::add.png[width="579"]

After kbd:[Ctrl] has been pressed, it automatically inserts the
first prefix `PREFIX_NAME` in the command line.

image::addPREFIX_NAME.png[width="581"]

**Step 3**: After the user fills up the `PREFIX_NAME` field, he can press
kbd:[Space] to move on to the next prefix. After pressing kbd:[Space], then
he can press kbd:[Ctrl]. At this point, `AutoCompleteManager()` is
called again but this time instead of calling the `getAutoCompleteCommands()`
it calls `getAutoCompleteNextMissingParameter` since it will detect
the presence of the `PREFIX_NAME` parameter.

This is the expected outcome before pressing kbd:[Ctrl]

image::anthonyspace.png[width="581"]

This is the expected outcome after pressing kbd:[Ctrl]

image::afteranthonyspace.png[width="581"]

**Step 4**: The user repeats Step 3 until all parameters are input by the user
and then presses kbd:[Enter] to execute the command.
Note: For `AddCommand`, the final parameter `PREFIX_TAG` is optional, so
the user can just delete it if he chooses not to add a tag.

This is the expected outcome after all the parameters are filled.

image::fulladdautocomplete.png[width="953"]

Press kbd:[Enter] to execute the command.

Given below is the activity diagram for the Autocomplete feature.

**Activity Diagram :**

image::AutocompleteActivityDiagram.png[width="331"]

Activity Diagram demonstrates what happens when user presses kbd:[Ctrl]

==== Current Implementation

The Autocomplete mechanism is facilitated by `AutoCompleteManager`, which
can be found in `LogicManager`. It supports the auto completion of incomplete
commands by providing a list of auto completed commands from a given incomplete
command.

An underlying `Trie` data structure is used to facilitate the `AutocompleteManager`.
`Trie` only supports autocompletion of commands that are provided by the
`AutocompleteManager`. The `CommandParameterSyntaxHandler` that is found in
`AutocompleteManager` supports the autocompletion of parameters for commands.

Given below is the class diagram for the Autocomplete feature.

**Autocomplete Class Diagram :**

image::AutocompleteClassDiagram.png[width="719"]

The `CommandBox` interacts with the `AutocompleteManager` using `LogicManager`.
When the user presses kbd:[Ctrl] in the command box, the `CommandBox` will
handle the Ctrl key press event and will execute the `AutoCompleteUserInput()`
method.

Given below is the sequence diagram for the Autocomplete feature.

**Autocomplete Sequence Diagram :**

image::AutocompleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="926"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of Autocomplete

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): ** Use a manager (`AutoCompleteManager`)
to handle the autocomplete helper methods.

** Pros:
Allows for better usability and more code abstraction.
** Cons:
The amount of time taken for a new developer to to understand all the
interaction between methods will be longer.

* **Alternative 2: ** Iterate through all possible commands to find match prefix.

** Pros:
Implementation of this alternative would be easier.
** Cons:
If there are too many commands being input consecutively, the application
might start to lag due to possible loss of performance.

===== Aspect: Implementation of Algorithm

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): ** Trie Data Structure

** Pros:
Performance of application will be better.
** Cons:
The complexity of implementation is higher.

* **Alternative 2: ** Iterate through all possible commands to find
match prefix.

** Pros:
Implementation of this alternative would be easier.
** Cons:
If there are too many commands being input consecutively, the application
might start to lag due to possible loss of performance.

// end::autocomplete[]

// tag::archive[]
=== [Proposed] Command Archive feature
Given below is the UML diagram for the `CommandArchive` Class:

image::CommandArchive_class.png[width="280"]

Given below is the UML diagram for the `CommandHistory` Class:

image::CommandHistory_class.png[width="345"]

==== Current Implementation

The Command Archive mechanism is facilitated by `CommandArchive`.
It utilises the `userInputHistory` to extract the latest command that the user
has input and passes the `inputString`to `stringToFile` method in `CommandArchive`
class. The `inputString` is then appended to the `CommandFile.txt` file.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `StringBuilder()` -- The main operations of the `StringBuilder` are the `append`
and `insert` methods which can be overloaded to accept data of any type. The `append`
method always adds these characters at the end of the builder.This operation
can be found in `CommandHistory`.

* `toString()` -- Converts the StringBuilder object into a string named
`inputString` so it can be passed to the `CommandArchive` class. This operation
can be found in `CommandHistory`.* `getLogger()` -- Creates `LOGGER` so that it
can log any `IOExceptions` that are caught in the catch blocks of the methods
found in `stringToFile` method of `CommandArchive`.

* `substring()` -- Extracts the latest command from the `userInputHistory`.
This is required because the `userInputHistory` appends all the older commands
into the LinkedList as well. This is done by looking for the first newLine character
occurrence of the `inputString`. The substring is then extracted as
`latestUserCommand`. This operation can be found in `CommandArchive`.

 * `simpleDateFormat()` -- Creates a `timeStamp` in DD/MM/YYY format that can later
 be appended to `latestUserCommand`. This operation can be found in `CommandArchive`.

 * `fileWriter` -- Writes the stream of characters (which is `latestUserCommand`)
to `commandHistory` file. This will eventually be the output that is written into
`commandFile.txt` via `PrintWriter`. The `PrintWriter` also appends `timeStamp`
to the latest entry (which is eventually `timeStamp` + `latestUserCommand`). This
operation can be found in CommandArchive`.

 This command requires a login.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to extract userInputHistory

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `userInputHistory` is first put into a
`stringBuilder` and then converted to string to then pass to `CommandArchive`.

** Pros:
1. Easy to implement because `StringBuilder` can utilise `append` and `insert`
methods, which can be overloaded to accept any data.
2. Faster than `StringBuffer` under most implementations.
3. StringBuilder is mutable while String is immutable.
** Cons: String is more optimised especially if you don't need the extra features
of `StringBuilder`
* **Alternative 2:** Create a KeyLogger class that implements KeyListener
to capture userInput.
** Pros: It is more secure and can only be accessed for audits and other
administrative access purposes and is hidden from the user.
** Cons:
1. If implemented wrongly, it will become a global KeyLogger that captures
userInput outside of application.

2. Does not utilise the existing infrastructure
and data found in the base level program class `CommandHistory` and hence
would require more effort to implement.
// end::archive[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_
// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Concierge depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

* Refer to the user guide to test more edge cases


[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Reassign

First, ensure that you have signed in by doing `login user/admin pw/passw0rd`.

* Reassigning a booking to another room
** Prerequisites: There is a booking in the room you want to reassign. Room 001 with its preloaded bookings and expenses is a good example to test this.
** Test case: `reassign r/001 from/16/11/18 nr/030` +
Expected: Booking in room 001 that starts from 16/11/18 is reassigned to room 030 (which has no bookings prior). Expenses from room 001 are
also ported over.

* Incorrect commands to try:
** `reassign r/001 from/32/11/18 nr/002` (invalid command, no such date)
** `reassign r/005 from/12/11/18 nr/101` (invalid command, no such new room)
** `reassign r/006 from/1/1/18 nr/007` (room 006 has no such booking)
** `reassign r/006 from/9/11/18 nr/007` (cannot reassign booking, because room 006 booking is expired)
