== Introduction

Welcome to *CLInic*! *CLInic* is a desktop application that is created for usage within a clinic, and optimised specifically for clinic receptionists and doctors who *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If this is your first time on this application, proceed to <<Setting up>> to get started with setting up your development environment. Following which, you can proceed to *Appendix A* to get started on your first task!

If you are already familiar with the basic development environment for this application and wish to understand the inner workings of this application at a higher level, proceed to <<Design>> and <<Implementation>>.

For more information on documentation, testing and dev ops for this application, refer to <<Documentation>>, <<Testing>> and <<Dev Ops>> respectively.

== Setting up

This section contains instructions on how to do a one-time set up of the developmental environment on IntelliJ.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

 This section contains information about the main architecture and design of various components in CLInic.

[IMPORTANT]
Note that since CLInic was built on top of the `addressbook-level4` application, `addressbook` and its associated acronyms are used interchangeably with `CLInic` for the rest of the guide.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four similarly designed components:

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and an `ObservableList<Medicine>` that can be 'observed' +
e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

For ease of use, classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

 This section contains some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

.Initial state
image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

.State after new command
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new patient. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

.State after another new command
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

.Performing an undo
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Sequence diagram for UndoCommand/RedoCommand.
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="000"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

.Non-modifying command state
image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

.Discard old commits after state pointer
image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

.Undo/Redo activity diagram
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::medicalrecord[]
=== Adding a MedicalRecord to a Patient
==== Current Implementation

The `MedicalRecord` class is an attribute of the `Patient` class, and it contains information regarding its `Patient` 's medical records. The `MedicalRecord` class:

* has an attribute `BloodType` which stores the blood type of the `Patient`. This attribute is marked as `final` and cannot be changed.
* contains a `List<DrugAllergy>` which stores the list of drug allergies that the `Patient` has.
* contains a `List<Disease>` which stores the list of diseases the `Patient` has.
* contains a `List<Note>` which stores the list of notes that belong to the `Patient`. Each `Note` further comprises a `Message` that stores the actual message of the `Note`, and a `Map<SerialNumber, Quantity>` attribute which is a record of the `SerialNumber` of the `Medicine` as well as the `Quantity` that had been dispensed to the `Patient` during that particular visit.

When a new `Patient` is created with the `AddCommand`, it is created with a default `MedicalRecord` object that contains an empty `BloodType` object, an empty `List<DrugAllergy>`, an empty `List<Disease>` and and empty `List<Note>`.

Users can add more information to a specified `Patient` 's `MedicalRecord` by invoking the `AddMedicalRecordCommand`, and specifying the corresponding arguments to add to the `MedicalRecord`. The arguments should be prefixed with `b/` for `BloodType`, `d/` for `Disease`, `da/` for `DrugAllergy`, and `m/` for `Note`. All the arguments here are optional arguments, however at least one must be present.

Given below is an example usage scenario and explanation for the inner workings of the `AddMedicalRecordCommand`.

Step 1. The user creates a new `Patient` object using the `AddCommand`. While the user has not provided any arguments for the `MedicalRecord` of this `Patient`, a empty `MedicalRecord` object has been initialised internally and assigned to this created `Patient`. Contents of this empty `MedicalRecord` is as detailed above.

Step 2. The user wishes to add a `MedicalRecord` containing only the `BloodType` of the `Patient`, and will do so with the `AddMedicalRecord` command, and only specifiying the `b/` prefix for `BloodType`. Note that `BloodType` here can only be in a specific format (A[\+-], B[+-], O[\+-] or AB[+-]).

When this command is executed, the program creates a new `MedicalRecord` object with just the `BloodType` specified, takes the old `MedicalRecord` object of the `Patient` (which is empty), and does a merging of the two objects, returning a new `MedicalRecord` object. The `Patient` is then updated with this new combined `MedicalRecord`. The following figure shows the sequence diagram for this command.

.Sequence diagram for AddMedicalRecordCommand.
image::addMedicalRecord-SequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

==== Design Considerations

This section lists out some of the different implementations that were considered during the designing phase of this feature, including the rationale for our choice.

===== Aspect: Execution of the command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `MedicalRecord` object and combine the old `MedicalRecord` with it.
** Pros: Easy to implement and better abstraction.
** Cons: Redundant creation of new object only to discard it immediately.
* **Alternative 2:** Add specified arguments of the command directly to the current `MedicalRecord`
** Pros: No redundant creation of extra objects.
** Cons: Require access to the existing `MedicalRecord` from outside the object, which breaks the abstraction barrier.

// end::medicalrecord[]

// tag::medicine[]
=== Medicine Records System
The medicine records system is used to manage the medicine inventory in the clinic.
It allows the clinic to automate the monitoring and management of their medicine supply easily.
There is great potential for this system to evolve, for example:

* Using artificial intelligence to manage the clinic supply without human intervention.
* Delivering first-hand information
from medical breakthroughs to treat patients more effectively.

==== Current Implementation
The _Medicine_ class and the properties of the medicine are located in <<Model component, *Model*>>.
They are modeled after the properties of a real medicine in a clinic context.
The list of medicines currently tracked in the clinic is located in the AddressBook class.

Refer to the diagram below for the commands that involves the _Medicine Class_:

.Class Diagram for Medicine Commands
image::ClassDiagramForMedicineCommands.png[width="650"]

Given below are examples of how the medicine commands are used:

Scenario 1: The clinic orders a new medicine that they do not currently possess.
 The clinic receptionist uses the `addMedicine` command to add the new medicine into the records.

Scenario 2: There is a wrong entry for one of the serial number of the medicine. The user uses the
`editmedicine` command to correct the serial number. The code on how it works is shown below:

[source,java]
----
public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        List<Medicine> lastShownList = model.getFilteredMedicineList();

        if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_MEDICINE_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        Medicine medicineToEdit = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
        Medicine editedMedicine = createEditedMedicine(medicineToEdit, medicineDescriptor);

        if (!medicineToEdit.isSameMedicine(editedMedicine)
                && model.hasMedicine(editedMedicine)) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_MEDICINE);
        }

        /* The following three methods checks if the new medicine name or
        new serial number that is entered used by other medicines in CLInic.
        If so, they throw an error specifying which of the two is duplicated.
        This is done as the medicine name and serial number are unique to a medicine.
        */

        checkBothNewMedicineNameAndSerialNumberAlreadyExisting(model, editedMedicine);
        checkNewSerialNumberAlreadyExisting(model, editedMedicine);
        checkNewMedicineNameAlreadyExisting(model, editedMedicine);

        model.updateMedicine(medicineToEdit, editedMedicine);
        model.updateFilteredMedicineList(Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_MEDICINES);
        model.commitAddressBook();

        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowMedicineListEvent());

        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_EDIT_MEDICINE_SUCCESS, editedMedicine));
    }
}
----

Scenario 3: The doctor prescribes the patient he is serving a medicine. The `dispensemedicine` command is entered.
The stock level of the medicine is then updated. The *sequence diagram* below shows how the code works:

.Sequence Diagram for `dispensemedicine`
image::DispenseMedicineSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Scenario 4: The clinic receptionist needs to check for the stock level of every medicine.
He executes the `checkStock` command
which lists *all* medicines that are below their _Minimum Stock Quantity_. See the figure below for an example
of how the filter works:

.Filter medicines that are low in supply
image::checkstockfilter.png[width="450"]

==== Design Considerations
// preface
The medicines in the clinic need to be stored in a Java Collection.
We considered using a list or a hash map. See below for the analysis of each choice:

===== Aspect: Execution of the command

* **Current choice:** Stores the medicines in a list.
** Pros: Many easy and useful methods to manipulate medicines in the list such as `add`, `get` and `remove`.
** Cons: Relatively slow when searching through the list to find a medicine.
* **Alternative:** Stores the medicines in a hash map.
** Pros: Quick reference for object given the medicine name or serial number.
** Cons: Cumbersome and error-prone when there is a need to change the hash map into a list to manipulate the medicines.

//end::medicine[]

// tag::pqms[]
=== Patient Queue Management System
The Patient Queue Management System (PQMS) consists of three main classes: `PatientQueue`, `CurrentPatient` and `ServedPatientQueue`. A patient that
registers to see the doctor is put into the `PatientQueue`. When it is the patient's turn to see the doctor, he will become the `CurrentPatient`. After
he is done with seeing the doctor, he will become a `ServedPatient` and put into the  `ServedPatientQueue` to await payment and document processing.


.Class Diagram of PQMS
image::PQMSClassDiagram.png[width="850"]

`ServedPatient` acts as a wrapper for `Patient`, storing intermediate information that are likely to change during the patient's visit to the clinic.
`CurrentPatient` acts as a wrapper for `ServedPatient`, updating the intermediate information that it contains. These intermediate information are
`McContent`, `ReferralContent`, `NoteContent` and `Medicine` allocated.

The PQMS consists of the `register`, `insert`, `remove`, `serve`, `adddocument`, `displaydocuments`, `dispensemedicine`, `finish`, `payment` and <<Document,`Document`>> commands.

These commands inherit from `QueueCommand` because it will require more arguments in its execute command. The PQMS is not inside `Model` as it is only required during runtime;
it does not need to be saved into the database. A new `QueueCommand` abstract class that inherits from `Command` is created and it defines a new method signature of `execute`.

The following code snippet shows how the `QueueCommand` is implemented:

```Java
public abstract class QueueCommand extends Command {

    public CommandResult execute(Model model, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
        throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_WRONG_EXECUTE_COMMAND);
    }

    public abstract CommandResult execute(Model model, PatientQueue patientQueue, CurrentPatient currentPatient,
                            ServedPatientList servedPatientList, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException;

}
```

The follow code snippet shows how the `RegisterCommand` makes use of both the `Model` and `PatientQueue`
of the PQMS.

```Java
    public CommandResult execute(Model model, PatientQueue patientQueue, CurrentPatient currentPatient,
                                 ServedPatientList servedPatientList, CommandHistory history) throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(patientQueue);

        List<Patient> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        Patient patientToRegister = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());

        if (patientQueue.contains(patientToRegister) || currentPatient.isPatient(patientToRegister)
                || servedPatientList.containsPatient(patientToRegister)) {
            throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PATIENT);
        }

        int position = patientQueue.enqueue(patientToRegister);
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS + patientToRegister.toNameAndIc()
                + " with Queue Number: " + position + "\n" + patientQueue.displayQueue());
    }
```

For better illustration, the following sequence diagram shows how the `register` commands works:

.Sequence Diagram for RegisterCommand.
image::RegisterSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

The other PQMS commands roughly follow the same sequence as `Register` command but can interact with `CurrentPatient` or `ServedPatientList` instead of `PatientQueue`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the PQMS.

Step 1. Three patients visits the clinic, the user executes the `register` command for each patient. If these patients are not registered in CLInic's database they need to be added first.

.Registering 3 patients
image::PQMSPatientQueue.png[750, 225]

Step 2. The doctor is ready for the next patient. The user executes the `serve` command to serve the first patient in the queue.
The patient is now the `CurrentPatient`.

.Serve patient
image::PQMSCurrentPatient.png[750, 225]

Step 3. The user executes the `adddocument` command to add information to the `CurrentPatient`. These information will be used for document
processing later on.

Step 4. The `CurrentPatient` is done with the consultation. The user executes the `finish` command to transfer this patient to
the `ServedPatientQueue`. Afterwards, the user executes `serve` to serve the next patient in `PatientQueue`.

.Finish serving patient
image::PQMSServedPatientQueue.png[750, 225]

Step 5. The user executes various `Document` commands to generate necessary documents for the served patient.

Step 6. The user finally executes `payment` command to end the patient's visit to the clinic, removing
him from the `ServedPatientQueue`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Proper OOP practice
Relationship between `CurrentPatient`, `ServedPatient` and `Patient`.

* **Current Implementation:** Composition
** `CurrentPatient` is composed of `ServedPatient`. `ServedPatient` is composed of `Patient`.
** Pros: Easy manipulation of composed class.
** Cons: Weird relationship between the three classes. i.e. `ServedPatient` has-a `Patient`.
* **Alternative:** Inheritance
* `CurrentPatient` inherits from `ServedPatient`. `ServedPatient` inherits from `Patient`.
** Pros: Proper relationship between three classes.
** Cons: Cannot cast `Patient` to `ServedPatient` or `CurrentPatient` for usage in PQMS.

[[Document]]
=== Document
==== Implementation of `Document`
The `Document` abstract class represents all the documents that can be issued by the clinic. The `Receipt`,
 `MedicalCertificate` and `ReferralLetter` concrete classes, which respective *commands* will be referred
 to henceforth as _document related commands_, all inherit from it. It can be thought of as a *formatter* that
 specifies and organises the common information that all these documents must have with the help of the `DocumentTemplate.html`
 template file. +
 Shown below is a class diagram  illustrating how `Document`, `Receipt`, `MedicalCertificate` and
 `ReferralLetter` relate to one another.

.Class diagram representing how the `Document` and _document related_ classes are implemented.
image::DocumentClassDiagram.png[width="900"]

As the formatter which directs how the documents are built from the `DocumentTemplate.html` template, the `Document`
`abstract class` itself *cannot* be instantiated.  The `Document` `abstract class` has the following key features:

* contains the `name` and `icNumber` attributes, extracted from the `ServedPatient` from which the `Document` was constructed from.
* has common methods like `generateContent` to standardise the way in which the contents of the `Document` are formatted.
* has the `formatInformation` `abstract method` which the extending classes have to implement.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens internally when a _document related command_ is executed.

.Flow of activities when a _document related command_ is executed. Only the methods that are *implemented* within `Document` itself are labelled in the diagram.
image::DocumentActivityDiagram.png[width="900"]

As seen in the above activity diagram, upon executing a _document related command_, the corresponding document will
be constructed from the `ServedPatient` object specified by the `index` that was passed in with the command,
 as detailed in the following steps.

Step 1. The resulting _document related object_ will call the `generateDocument` method, which will first make a unique `fileName` for the file to be created, identified by the type of `Document`, `ServedPatient's` `name` and `icNumber`.
``` Java
private String makeFileName() {
    return (fileType + FILE_NAME_DELIMITER + "For" + FILE_NAME_DELIMITER + name.toString()
        + FILE_NAME_DELIMITER + icNumber.toString())
        .replaceAll("\\s", FILE_NAME_DELIMITER)
        .replaceAll("(_)+", FILE_NAME_DELIMITER);
}
```
[TIP]
====
The `FILE_NAME_DELIMITER` is abstracted so as to allow users to change the delimiter to a `string` of their choice.
It is used as a means of separating fields of information in file names.
====
Step 2. The `DocumentTemplate.html` file is then converted into a `string`. It is a template with placeholder
values prefixed by a `$` that will be replaced with the actual information pertaining to the `ServedPatient's`
consultation. +
Shown below is the code snippet that converts the `DocumentTemplate` `HTML` file into a `string`.
``` Java
private String convertHtmlIntoString() {
    StringBuilder contentBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    try {
        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(COMPLETE_TEMPLATE_PATH));
        String str;
        while ((str = in.readLine()) != null) {
            contentBuilder.append(str).append("\n");
        }
        in.close();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println(TEMPLATE_LOCATE_FAILURE_ERROR_MESSAGE);
    }
    return contentBuilder.toString();
}
```
Step 3. The `generateContent` method will then be called within the `writeContentsIntoDocumentTemplate` method.
The `generateContent` method will construct a `HashMap` of `string` to `string` key-value pairs. The keys are the aforementioned
placeholder `strings` prefixed by `$` found in the `HTML` template, while the values are the corresponding information that are to
substitute the placeholders in the `HTML` template(keys). The `writeContentsIntoDocumentTemplate` method will then use the
key-value pairs found in the `HashMap` created by the `generateContent` method to replace the placeholder values in the
`HTML` template.
``` Java
private String writeContentsIntoDocumentTemplate() {
    String htmlContent = convertHtmlIntoString();
    String title = fileType + " for " + this.name;
    htmlContent = htmlContent.replace("$title", title);
    HashMap<String, String> fieldValues = this.generateContent();
    for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : fieldValues.entrySet()) {
        String key = entry.getKey();
        String value = entry.getValue();
        htmlContent = htmlContent.replace(key, value);
    }
    return htmlContent;
}

private HashMap<String, String> generateContent() {
    HashMap<String, String> informationFieldPairs = new HashMap<>();
    informationFieldPairs.put(HEADER_PLACEHOLDER, generateHeaders());
    informationFieldPairs.put(NAME_PLACEHOLDER, name.toString());
    informationFieldPairs.put(ICNUMBER_PLACEHOLDER, icNumber.toString());
    informationFieldPairs.put(CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER, formatInformation());
    return informationFieldPairs;
}
```
Step 4. Now that the `HTML` template is a `string` with the placeholder values replaced by the correct information, a `BufferedOutputStream`
is used to write the updated `string` into the `HTML` file, concluding the generation of the `Document` `HTML` file.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Implementation of the Document
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use an `abstract class` to implement `Document`. +
** Pros:
*** Allows inheriting classes to use a standardised method to format common information while granting them the
flexibility of structuring the contents unique to its document type by means of `abstract methods`.
** Cons:
*** Prevents inheriting classes from becoming an `Enum` as `Java` does not support `multiple inheritance`, since all `enums` implicitly inherit from `Enum`.
*** More computationally expensive than an `interface` due to the overhead incurred looking up inherited methods and various class members.
* **Alternative 2**: Use an `interface` to implement `Document`.
** Pros:
*** Can convert inheriting classes to `enums`, ensuring that the inputs fed to these classes are valid.
****
`Enums` can restrict the period of medical leave to be counted in only days/weeks. This prevents absurd scenarios like issuing a `Medical Certificate` that excuses a person from work/school for 10 **years**!
****
** Cons:
*** Unable to standardise the way inheriting classes implement the `generateHeader` method.
****
* Potentially allow the inheriting classes to omit certain header fields that are relevant to the printing of a document, such as the `date` and `time` of the consultation.
* Information might be formatted differently.
****
//end::documentpreamble[]

// tag::receipt[]
==== Implementation of `Receipt`
The `Receipt` class structure is as follows:

* Contains a `Map<Medicine, MedicineQuantity>` attribute to record the quantity dispensed of each type of `Medicine` to the `ServedPatient` from which the `Receipt` was constructed from.
* Contains a `HashSet<Service>` attribute to record the `Services` administered to the patient.
* Contains a `totalPrice` attribute which stores the total price of all the `Services` and `Medicines` received by the patient during the consultation.

Users can generate a `Receipt` for a specific `ServedPatient` by invoking the `ReceiptCommand` accompanied by the
 `ServedPatient` 's index in the `ServedPatientList`. The below sequence diagram illustrates how the `ReceiptCommand` works.

.Sequence diagram for ReceiptCommand.
image::ReceiptSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

When the `ReceiptCommand` is executed, it constructs a new `Receipt` object and extracts the relevant information
from the `ServedPatient` specified by the `index`. +
Shown below is how the `Map<Medicine, MedicineQuantity>` of a `ServedPatient` is unpacked to sieve out the individual
 table entries for the cost of different medicines.
``` Java
    private String unpackMedicineAllocation(Map<Medicine, QuantityToDispense> medicineAllocated) {
        StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        for (Map.Entry<Medicine, QuantityToDispense> entry : medicineAllocated.entrySet()) {
            Medicine medicine = entry.getKey();
            String medicineName = medicine.getMedicineName().toString();
            int quantity = entry.getValue().getValue();
            float pricePerUnit = Float.parseFloat(medicine.getPricePerUnit().toString());
            float totalPriceForSpecificMedicine = pricePerUnit * quantity;
            increaseTotalPriceBy(totalPriceForSpecificMedicine);
            stringBuilder.append("<tr><td>")
                    .append(medicineName)
                    .append(super.HTML_TABLE_DATA_DIVIDER)
                    .append(quantity)
                    .append(super.HTML_TABLE_DATA_DIVIDER)
                    .append(String.format("%.02f", pricePerUnit))
                    .append(super.HTML_TABLE_DATA_DIVIDER)
                    .append(String.format("%.02f", totalPriceForSpecificMedicine))
                    .append("</td></tr>");
        }
        return stringBuilder.toString();
    }
```

// end::receipt[]

// tag::mc[]
==== Implementation of `MedicalCertificate`
The `MedicalCertificate` class structure is as follows:

* Has attributes of the `ServedPatient` it is generated from, which includes the `ServedPatient` 's `name` and `IcNumber`.
** These attributes are marked as `final` as they should not be changed.
* Contains additional information like the duration, start-date and end-date of their medical leave.

Users can generate a `MedicalCertificate` for a specific `ServedPatient` by invoking the `MedicalCertificateCommand`
 accompanied by the `ServedPatient` 's index in the `ServedPatientList`.
 The below sequence diagram illustrates how the `MedicalCertificateCommand` works.

// to be updated by Syahiran
.Sequence diagram for MedicalCertificateCommand.
image::MCSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

When the `MedicalCertificateCommand` is executed, it will construct a new `MedicalCertificate` object and extract the relevant information
from the `ServedPatient` specified by the `index`.
Shown below is how information like `numMcDays` is formatted into the medical certificate document template.
``` Java
    public String formatInformation() {
            int numMcDays = getMcDays();
            DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd/MM/yyyy");

            StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
            stringBuilder.append("This is to certify that the above-named patient is unfit for duty for a period of ")
                    .append("<b>" + numMcDays + "</b>")
                    .append(" <b>day(s)</b>, from ")
                    .append("<b>" + LocalDate.now().format(formatter) + "</b>")
                    .append(" <b>to</b> ")
                    .append("<b>" + LocalDate.now().plusDays(numMcDays - 1).format(formatter) + "</b>")
                    .append(" <b>inclusive.</b><br><br>")
                    .append("This certificate is not valid for absence from court attendance.<br><br>")
                    .append("<b>Issuing Doctor:</b> Dr Chester Sng" + "<br>");
            return stringBuilder.toString();
        }
```

[WARNING]
Executing `mc` with an invalid index will **not** result in the generation of a `MedicalCertificate`.
// end::mc[]

// tag::referralletter[]
==== Implementation of `ReferralLetter`
The `ReferralLetter` class structure is as follows:

* Has attributes of the `ServedPatient` it is generated from, which includes the `ServedPatient` 's `name` and `IcNumber`.
** These attributes are marked as `final` as they should not be changed.
* Contains additional information like the doctor's notes and patient's referred location.

Users can generate a `ReferralLetter` for a specific `ServedPatient` by invoking the `ReferralLetterCommand`
 accompanied by the `ServedPatient` 's index in the `ServedPatientList`.
 The below sequence diagram illustrates how the `ReferralLetterCommand` works.

// to be updated by Syahiran
.Sequence diagram for ReferralLetterCommand.
image::RLSequenceDiagram.png[width="900"]

When the `ReferralLetterCommand` is executed, it will construct a new `ReferralLetter` object and extract the relevant information
from the `ServedPatient` specified by the `index`.
Shown below is how information like `referralContent` and `noteContent` are formatted into the referral letter document template.
``` Java
    public String formatInformation() {
            String referralContent = getReferralContent();
            String noteContent = getNoteContent();

            StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
            stringBuilder.append("This is to certify that the above-named patient has been referred to: ")
                    .append("<b>" + referralContent.toUpperCase() + "</b>" + "<br><br>")
                    .append("Dear Specialist, please assist the above-named patient in the following matter:<br>")
                    .append(noteContent + "<br><br>")
                    .append("Kindly do accept him under your care. Thank you very much.<br><br>")
                    .append("<b>Issuing Doctor:</b> Dr Chester Sng" + "<br>");
            return stringBuilder.toString();
        }
```

[WARNING]
Executing `refer` with an invalid index will **not** result in the generation of a `ReferralLetter`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `adddocument`, `MedicalCertificate` and `ReferralLetter` Commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The issuing doctor's name is hard-coded into the `MedicalCertificate` and `ReferralLetter` HTML template.
** Pros: No need for an extra parameter to key in the issuing doctor's name, which is helpful when there is only one doctor working in a clinic.
** Cons: There may be more than one doctor working in a clinic.
* **Alternative 2:** Include a mandatory parameter `id/ISSUING_DOCTOR` to the `adddocument` command for the issuing doctor to key in his/her name.
** Pros: Different doctors can sign off the medical certificates and referral letters.
** Cons: Slightly more typing is necessary before doctors can execute the `adddocument` command.
// end::referralletter[]

// tag::applicationgui[]
=== Application GUI

==== Current Implementation
As an extension to the original addressbook-level4 application, more UI elements were added to the application window to serve as visual aid for the user of the application.

In particular, the real-time status of the Patient Queue Management System (PQMS) is reflected to the user via a small window near the top of the application. This is depicted in the figure below:

.GUI for the PQMS
image::PQMS-gui.png[width="850"]

After `QueueCommands` such as `register`, `serve`, etc., the GUI will automatically update itself as the user enters these commands to reflect the situation of the PQMS at that exact point in time.

This UI element is implemented using JavaFX's `WebView` and a local HTML file. The sequence of events for how the `WebView` is updated is as follows:

Step 1. On a fresh start-up of the application, the `WebView` is intialized with the local HTML file `QueueDisplay.html` that draws the labels and boxes onto the `WebView`.

Step 2. After each `QueueCommand`, a `QueueUpdatedEvent` is posted and the subscribed class `QueueDisplay` invokes the `runScript()` method on the `WebViewScript` object within the class.

Step 3. `WebViewScript.runScript()` simply calls an `executeScript()` method that subsequently executes some JavaScript code on the HTML file that will render the appropriate illustration to be displayed on the `WebView`.

Step 4. On each subsequent `QueueCommand`, steps 2 to 3 are repeated to update the display.

The following figure show the code section of the 2 methods that are responsible for the display:

```java
/**
 * File: QueueDisplay.java
 * Loads a HTML file representing the queue display.
 */
private void loadQueueDisplay(PatientQueue patientQueue, ServedPatientList servedPatientList, CurrentPatient currentPatient) {
    List<Patient> patientQueueList = patientQueue == null ? null : patientQueue.getPatientsAsList();
    String currentPatientString;
    if (currentPatient == null) {
        currentPatientString = "empty";
    } else {
        try {
            currentPatientString = currentPatient.getPatient().getName().fullName;
        } catch (NullPointerException npe) {
            currentPatientString = "empty";
        }
    }
    List<ServedPatient> servedPatients = servedPatientList == null ? null : servedPatientList.getPatientsAsList();

    String queueDisplayPage = MainApp.class.getResource(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + DEFAULT_PAGE).toExternalForm();
    this.webViewScript.runScript(getScriptForQueueDisplay(patientQueueList, currentPatientString, servedPatients));
    loadPage(queueDisplayPage);
}
```

```java

/**
 * File: WebViewScriptManager.java
 * This function will run script that is passed as argument.
 * @param script script to run.
 */
public void runScript(String script) {
    int currentCounter = this.counter;
    this.webView.getEngine().getLoadWorker().stateProperty().addListener((ObservableValue<? extends Worker.State> observable, Worker.State oldValue, Worker.State newValue) -> {
        if (newValue == Worker.State.SUCCEEDED && currentCounter == this.counter) {
            Platform.runLater(() -> this.webView.getEngine().executeScript(script));
            this.counter++;
        }
    });
}
```

==== Design Considerations

This section lists out some of the different implementations that were considered during the designing phase of this feature, including the rationale for our choice.

===== Aspect: Implementation approach
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Using a `WebView` to display HTML code +
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement, since the code to render the display is a completely separate code. Abstraction barrier is maintained.
** Cons:
*** Might face lagging issues for prolonged time usage, since one new `Listener` object is created for each update.
* **Alternative 2**: Using JavaFX to render the shapes and UI.
** Pros:
*** Less likely to face efficiency issues since changing of the UI elements happens locally.
** Cons:
*** Hard to implement.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution.
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App.
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

 This section contains information on how we manage the documentation for CLInic. We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

 This section contains information on how to run tests and the different kind of tests in CLInic.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

This section contains more information on future developments and the tools we use for different aspects of development.

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all patients in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/patient/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a patient, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/patient/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each patient, and remove the `tag` from each patient.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last patient in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside patient cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the address book is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of patients when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of patients whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of patients status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a patient specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first patient to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first patient.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each patient later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/patient/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/patient/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/patient/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/patient/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the patient will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/patient/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the patient that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a patient.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
