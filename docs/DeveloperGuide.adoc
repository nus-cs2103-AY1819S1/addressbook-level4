// tag::introduction[]
== Introduction
Welcome to the SuperTA Developer Guide. This guide provides information to help you get started as a SuperTA contributor, allowing you to code, test and improve on the software without much hassle.

SuperTA is a desktop application for Teaching Assistants and Professors in NUS School of Computing. It provides a convenient, flexible and fast method to manage students and their tutorials. This software is also designed to have the Command Line Interface (CLI) to be the primary mode of input while the GUI is used for visual feedback to the user.

If you're brand new to SuperTA and want to jump into code, start with <<Setting up>>.
// end::introduction[]

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/superta/storage/XmlAdaptedStudent.java[`XmlAdaptedStudent.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/superta/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.superta.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-2` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-2`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-assignment as/lab1 tg/04a`.

.Component interactions for `delete-assignment as/lab1 tg/04a` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeleteAssignment.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `SuperTaChangedEvent` when the SuperTA client data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete-assignment as/lab1 tg/04a` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeleteAssignmentEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/superta/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/superta/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `SuperTaClientParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete assignment as/lab1 tg/04a")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-assignment as/lab1 tg/04a` Command
image::DeleteAssignmentSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/superta/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the SuperTA client data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>`,`ObservableList<Attendance>` and `ObservableList<TutorialGroup>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `SuperTaClient`, which `Student` can reference. This would allow `SuperTaClient` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/superta/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the SuperTA client data in xml format and read it back.

// end::tutorialgroup[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.superta.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSuperTaClient`.
It extends `SuperTaClient` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `superTaClientStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSuperTaClient#commit()` -- Saves the current SuperTA client state in its history.
* `VersionedSuperTaClient#undo()` -- Restores the previous SuperTA client state from its history.
* `VersionedSuperTaClient#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone SuperTA client state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSuperTaClient()`, `Model#undoSuperTaClient()` and `Model#redoSuperTaClient()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSuperTaClient` will be initialized with the initial SuperTA client state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single SuperTA client state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the SuperTA client. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSuperTaClient()`, causing the modified state of the SuperTA client after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `superTaClientStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted SuperTA client state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitSuperTaClient()`, causing another modified SuperTA client state to be saved into the `superTaClientStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSuperTaClient()`, so the SuperTA client state will not be saved into the `superTaClientStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSuperTaClient()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous SuperTA client state, and restores the SuperTA client to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial SuperTA client state, then there are no previous SuperTA client states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSuperTaClient()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoSuperTaClient()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the SuperTA client to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `superTaClientStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest SuperTA client state, then there are no undone SuperTA client states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSuperTaClient()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the SuperTA client, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSuperTaClient()`, `Model#undoSuperTaClient()` or `Model#redoSuperTaClient()`. Thus, the `superTaClientStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `superTaClientStateList`, all SuperTA client states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire SuperTA client.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of SuperTA client states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedSuperTaClient`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::deleteassignment[]
=== Delete Assignment feature

==== Current Implementation

The `delete-assignment` command is facilitated by the `DeleteAssignmentCommand` class.
It extends the abstract class `Command` and is supported by `DeleteAssignmentCommandParser`,
and changes made to the `Model` are done through `Model#deleteAssignment()`.

The `delete-assignment` command is executed in the following way:

. `LogicManager` calls `parseCommand()` of `SuperTaClientParser`, with the user input as the argument.
. `SuperTaClientParser` invokes `parse()` of `DeleteAssignmentCommandParser`.
. If arguments are valid, `parse` extracts `fromTutorialGroup` and `assToDelete` strings to instantiate a `DeleteAssignmentCommand`.
. The `DeleteAssignmentCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`, which calls `execute()` on it.
. `DeleteAssignment` calls `Model#deleteAssignment()` using `fromTutorialGroup` and `assToDelete`.

The following is a sequence diagram of the `delete-assignment` command:

image::DeleteAssignmentSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `DeleteAssignmentCommand`

* *Alternative 1(current choice):* Store the tutorial group ID and assignment title as String fields in `DeleteAssignmentCommand`.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Does not require instantiating new `TutorialGroup` and `Assignment` objects to hold the String values.
** Cons: Requires that the `Model` supports finding a tutorial group and assignment within `Model#deleteAssignment()`.
* *Alternative 2:* Wrap the tutorial group ID and assignment title in `TutorialGroup` and `Assignment` objects and store them as fields in `DeleteAssignmentCommand`.
** Pros: Easy to compare between actual `TutorialGroup` and `Assignment` using `equals()`.
** Cons: Dependent on the overridden `equals()` method  in the `TutorialGroup` and `Assignment` classes to work as intended.

// end::deleteassignment[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find feature

==== Current Implementation

The `find` command is facilitated by the `FindCommand` class.
It extends the abstract class `Command`,
and it is triggered when the user enters `find` into `SuperTaClient`.

The sequence diagram below shows the overview when `FindCommand` is called:

image::SDFindCommand.png[width="800"]

The `FindCommand` is implemented as follows:

. `LogicManager` is called to execute the entered argument.
. `LogicManager` calls `SuperTaClientParser`, and parses the argument through the method `parseCommand()`.
. `SuperTaClientParser` calls its respective command parsers of the argument using `parse()`. In this case, the `FindCommandParser` is called.
. `FindCommandParser` will now parse the arguments and turn into `name`, `phone`, `email` and `studentID` predicates. These predicates will be passed to `FindCommand`.
. When `LogicManager` invokes `execute()`, `FindCommand` will call `updateFilteredStudentList()` to the model component and update the student list to the latest results.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `FindCommandParser` parse predicates

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Each parameter field (ie `name`, `phone`) are parsed into its respective predicates (ie. `namePredicate`, `phonePredicate`).
** Pros: Easy to implement. Predicates are grouped into how they are parsed.
** Cons: Less user-friendly. Users are required to remember the prefixes for each field.
* *Alternative 2:* Parse all arguments into a general `string`, then search all the fields and stored into a main predicate.
** Pros: More versatile and user-friendly. The `string` is able to search all the fields.
** Cons: Slightly more tedious as compared to alternative 1. The general `string` needs to parse into respective field objects and predicates for each available parameter.

// end::find[]

// tag::updateassignment[]
=== Update Assignment feature

==== Current Implementation

The `update-assignment` command is facilitated by `UpdateAssignmentCommand` class.
It extends the abstract class `command`,
and it is triggered when the user enters `update-assignment` into `SuperTaClient`.
Actual changes of this command are made through `Model#updateAssignment()`.

The `UpdateAssignmentCommand` is implemented as follows:

[NOTE]
`UpdateAssignmentCommand` only works when there is an existing assignment in an existing tutorial group,
and the updated assignment name is not the same as other existing assignment title.
In this implementation, it is assumed that there is a valid tutorial group and a valid existing assignment.

.Logic component of the Sequence Diagram for `update-assignment` command
image::SDUpdateAssignmentCommandLogic.png[width="800"]

. `LogicManager` is called to execute the entered argument.
. `LogicManager` calls `SuperTaClientParser`, and parses the argument through the method `parseCommand()`.
. `SuperTaClientParser` calls its respective command parsers of the argument using `parse()`. In this case, the `UpdateAssignmentCommandParser()` is called.
. `UpdatAassignmentCommandParser` will now parse the arguments.
. `UpdateAssignmentCommandParser` will create a new `UpdateAssignmentDescriptor` and set the updated assignment details, which later will be passed to `UpdateAssignmentCommand`.
. When `LogicManager` invokes `execute()`, `UpdateAssignmentCommand` will call `updateAssignment()` to the model component.

.Model component of the Sequence Diagram for `update-assignment` command
image::SDUpdateAssignmentCommandModel.png[width="800"]

. When `updateAssignment()` is called in `ModelManager`, it will retrieve `tutorialGroup` and `assignment` information from `SuperTaClient` and `TutorialGroup` respectively.
. After locating the specific `assignment` to be changed, `ModelManager` now calls `updateAssignment()` to `UiqueAssignmentList` to replace the old assignment details.
. Updated information will be returned to the `logic` component (as ‘updated’) in the above diagram.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UpdateAssignmentDescriptor` in `UpdateAssignmentCommand`

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):*  Use of `UpdateAssignmentDescriptor` in `UpdateAssignmentCommand` to store the updated `assignment` details.
** Pros: Strengthen Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), as the `UpdateAssignmentCommand` will not need to check for differences between the old and updated `assignment` details.
** Cons: May increase coupling. If the additional `assignment` details are added in in the future such as section maximum marks, `UpdateAssignmentDescriptor` have to change accordingly as well.
* *Alternative 2:* Remove `UpdateAssignmentDescriptor` and parse updated `assignment` details as a new `assignment`.
** Pros: Decreases coupling.
** Cons: Harder to implement if user only indicate to update one field. (eg: update `assignmentTitle` only, while `maxMarks` stay the same). In this case, `UpdateAssignmentCommand` need to factor in the differences changed after the updated `assignment` details.

===== Aspect: Data structure of `update-assignment` in `ModelManager`

* *Alternative 1:*  Locate `assignment` from `assignmentList`, then delete old `assignment` and add updated `assignment`.
** Pros: Easier to implement as it made use of other existing assignment commands such as `addAssignment()` and `deleteAssignment()`. No additional methods are needed for `updateAssignment()`.
** Cons: As each assignment contains a `GradeBook` which stores all student grades, deleting the old `assignment` and add a new `assignment` may risk of losing the existing `GradeBook` records. In addition, assignment index list may be affected after deletion as well.
* *Alternative 2 (current choice):* Locate `assignment` from `assignmentList` and replace the old `assignment` with updated `assignment` details.
** Pros: No risk of losing `GradeBook` records as only the `assignmentTitle` and `maxMarks` are being edited.
** Cons: An additional method, `updateAssignment()` will be implemented instead.

// end::updateassignment[]

// tag::markattendancefeature[]
=== Mark Attendance feature

==== Current Implementation

The `mark-attendance` command is facilitated by the `MarkAttendanceCommand` class.
It extends the abstract class `Command` and is supported by `MarkAttendanceCommandParser`,
and changes made to the `Model` are done through `Model#markAttendance()`.

The `mark-attendance` command is executed in the following way:

. `LogicManager` calls `parseCommand()` of `SuperTaClientParser`, with the user input as the argument.
. `SuperTaClientParser` invokes `parse()` of `MarkAttendanceCommandParser`.
. If arguments are valid, `parse` extracts `tutorialGroupId` string, `sessionName` and set of `studentId` strings for parsing into a `Session` and `Set<StudentId>` to instantiate a `MarkAttendanceCommand`.
. The `MarkAttendanceCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`, which calls `execute()` on it.
. `MarkAttendance` calls `Model#markAttendance()` using `tgtId`, `sessionName` and `studentIdSet`.

The following sequence diagrams of the `mark-attendance` command shows the sequence flow from `LogicManager` to the `ModelManager`:

image::SDforMarkAttendance1.png[width="1856"]

A more in-depth sequence diagram to illustrate how the `Model` executes the `mark-attendance` command:

image::SDforMarkAttendance2.png[width="1452"]

From the in-depth sequence diagram:

. `Model` calls `VersionedSuperTaClient#markAttendance`, using `tgtId`, `sessionName` and `studentIdSet`.
. `VersionedSuperTaClient` self-invokes the method `getTutorialGroup(tgId)` to obtain the tutorial group specified.
. `VersionedSuperTaClient` then calls `getSession(sessionName)` in the `TutorialGroup` instance obtained previously.
. `VersionedSuperTaClient` then streams the set of student Ids obtained in `studentIdSet`, mapping them to new `Attendance` objects and collecting them as a list.
. Finally, the `attendanceList` obtained is streamed, with each `Attendance` object being added to the `Session` instance obtained in step 3.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `MarkAttendanceCommand`

* *Alternative 1(current choice):* Store the tutorial group ID as String field, session name as a `Session` object and student ids as a set of `StudentIds` in `MarkAttendanceCommand`.
** Pros: Easy to implement, and parse, with existing parsers built in. Ensures that parsed `Session` and `StudentId` objects are valid and abide by constraints.
** Cons: Requires `Session` and `StudentId` objects to be instantiated. Also depends on `isSameSession()` method and `containsId()` method in `Session` and `UniqueStudentList` respectively.
* *Alternative 2:* Store all parameters of `MarkAttendanceCommand` as String objects, including `StudentIds` as a set of Strings.
** Pros: Easy to implement, will be able to find session and set of student ids by comparing strings.
** Cons: Cannot ensure parsed session names and student ids are correct, valid and fit constraints.

===== Aspect: Implementation of `Attendance`

* *Alternative 1(current choice):* Store `Attendance` object with an encapsulated `StudentId` object and `Presence` enumeration.
** Pros: `StudentId` is assured to be valid, while `Presence` will only be able to take fixed, constant values,
** Cons: Requires a new `Presence` enumeration to be defined, instead of relying on simpler string values.
* *Alternative 2:* Store presence of student as an integer or string value.
** Pros: Easy to implement, no need to create additional enumeration.
** Cons: Cannot ensure that only fixed, valid values will be used when creating `Attendance` objects.

// end::markattendancefeature[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.superta.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.superta.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.superta.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.superta.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, SuperTA depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]

== Product Scope
