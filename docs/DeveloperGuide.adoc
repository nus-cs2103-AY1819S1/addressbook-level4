By: `CS2103T W12-3 Team`      Since: `Sept 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/commons/util/XmlUtilTest.java[`XmlUtilTest.java`] and link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands from the user interface command box
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with our coding standards but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the `CS2103T W12-3 Team` branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S1-W12-3/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819S1-W12-3/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<Implementation>> for a more detailed description of the implementation of our features.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `BrowserPanel`, `MainDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

.Structure of the TestPage Component
image::TestPageDiagram.png[width="800"]

Structure for the Test Page Component has also been modified to contain and expand the functionality of the application.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Trivia Bundle data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Card>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo Feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::import[]
=== Mass Import Feature

==== Current implementation
The import mechanism allows the user to add multiple cards quickly into 3VIA.
This is done by parsing an external file in a specified format and file type but with minimal syntax.

The import mechanism is facilitated mainly by `ImportFile` and `TriviaBundle`.
Additionally, the import mechanism implements the following operations:

* `ImportFile#parseFileToCard()` -- Parses a plain text file into a unique list of cards.
* `TriviaBundle#haveAnyCard()` -- Checks if the cards to add contain any duplicated cards already in `TriviaBundle`.
* `TriviaBundle#addMultipleCards()` -- Adds multiple cards into the `TriviaBundle` at once.

The 2 `TriviaBundle` operations are exposed in the Model interface as
`Model#haveAnyCard()` and `Model#addMultipleCards()` respectively.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the import command.

image::ImportCommandActivityDiagram.png[ImportCommandActivityDiagram]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the import mechanism behaves.

Step 1. The user enters the import command to import a file from an absolute or relative file path.
An `ImportCommand` object is initialised.

Step 2. When the `ImportCommand` executes, the desired import file is first verified to be valid by calling `ImportFile#isFileValid()`.
The following checks are done:

* `#isValidFile()` -- the import file's path points to a file and the file is non-empty.
* `#isValidFileType()` the import file is of a supported file type (i.e. plain/text file format).
* `#isValidFileFormat()` the import file is readable and the text in the import file is in the specified format.

Step 3. Once verified, the import file is parsed to form a unique list of cards that is stored in `UniqueCardList`.

NOTE: An empty `UniqueCardList` is also considered as an import failure as no cards were parsed from the given text file.
A  `CommandException` will be thrown, and the user is informed that no cards (question and answer pair) were found in the text file.

Step 4. `TriviaBundle#haveAnyCard()` checks every card in the `UniqueCardList` against the existing list of cards in `TriviaBundle` for duplicates.
If duplicates are found, the import fails and a `DuplicateCardException` is raised.

Step 5. The `UniqueCardList` is then added into `TriviaBundle` via `TriviaBundle#addMultipleCards()`.
The number of cards and the cards imported are displayed to the user for verification. +

The sequence diagram below describes the import of multiple cards.
Each card is added repeatedly by invoking `TriviaBundle#add()` until all cards in the `UniqueCardList` are added.

image::ImportMultipleCardsSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Pre-import preview
* **Alternative 1: (current implementation)** Single step to import cards from a text file.
** Pros:
*** A single command can be executed quickly for an import.
*** Post import edits can be done using existing commands such as `edit`, `delete`, etc.
** Con:
*** A single formatting error in the text file will result in an import failure.
* **Alternative 2:** 'Stages' the import file by first previewing the imported cards to the user.
Edits to the import file can be done directly to the text file within the application during this phase.
The actual import is then done upon confirmation.

** Implementation details: +
*** Given below is a class diagram describing the structure for the alternative import implementation. +
+
image::AlternativeImportClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*** The `Format` class verifies the formatting of the `ImportFile`, marks and displays the errors of the text file within the application for editing.
+
The `FileParser` is dependent on `Format` to determine whether each line in the text file is a topic or a question and an answer pair.
The `FileParser` parses the `ImportFile` into a `UniqueCardList` to be added.
+
The `ObservableFile` interface allows the UI component to update the preview of the cards each time the file is edited without a direct dependency to it.
** Pro:
*** Allows the user to identify errors in formatting and correct them directly in the application.
** Con:
*** An additional step (command) is required to successfully import the cards into the application.

===== Aspect: How import executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store all cards to be added in `TriviaBundle` before writing to file on the hard disk.
** Pro: Less IO intensive as only one write to file is needed.
** Con: May have heap memory issue if large amount of cards are stored temporarily.
* **Alternative 2:** Writes a card to a xml file after each card is added.
** Pro: Easy to implement.
** Con: May have performance issue when large amount of cards are added.

===== Aspect: How the import file is parsed
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Tokenize strings according to defined characters between question and answer, and between cards.
** Pro: Allows the user to undo/ redo an import as the execution of the import only executes `VersionedTriviaBundle#commit()` once.
** Con: May have memory performance issue as multiple cards are stored temporarily in the `TriviaBundle`.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Tokenize strings based on the `AddCommand` input format.
** Pro: Easy to implement as it allows reuse of the `AddCommand` functions.
** Con: Unable to undo/ redo import of cards as the execution of the import command executes `VersionedTriviaBundle#commit()` multiple times.
A successful undo/ redo of the import of all cards would require multiple executions of the undo/ redo command.
// end::import[]

// tag::triviatest[]
=== Structure of TriviaTest
==== Current Implementation
The term `TriviaTest` refers to a reference to the different kinds of testing features in 3VIA. Currently,
there are 2 test features in 3VIA, namely, the Open-Ended Test and the `MatchTest`.

Hence, the generic `TriviaTest` related classes were made to accommodate for the similarities between them. The classes that were
constructed spans across the Model, Storage and UI component. For Model, we have `TriviaTest`, `TriviaResult`, as shown in
https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w12-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#Design-Model[Model Diagram]. For Storage, we have
`TriviaResultsStorage`, as shown in https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w12-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#Design-Storage[Storage Diagram].
For UI, we have `TriviaTestPage` and `TriviaTestResultPage`, as shown in https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w12-3.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#Design-Ui[UI Diagram].

==== Design Considerations

===== The polymorphism of TriviaTest
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses different generic classes to accommodate the different testing feature in 3VIA.
** Pros: Follows Open-Close Principle which increases the extensibility of the testing feature in 3VIA.
It will also Increase the re-usability of similar codes.
** Cons: The implementation of different tests have to follow the structure of TriviaTest very strictly.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement each kinds of test as a standalone test with its own standalone class and event handlers.
** Pros: Easy to implement and each developer will have their freedom of how to implement their own test.
** Cons: Will lead to code that is increasingly not manageable.

===== The Model for TriviaTest's Results
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Another Model called `TriviaResult` is created to initialize the past TriviaTest's
tests and attempts.
** Pros: By creating `TriviaResult` instead of using `TriviaTest` for recording any past `TriviaTest` records, we can
reduce the amount of data collected. Hence, improving the performance (e.g. the start up time) of the application.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `TriviaTest` itself to initialize the past TriviaTest's tests and attempts.
** Pros: Since `TriviaResult` is a subset `TriviaTest`, it is possible to remove the need of `TriviaResult`, thereby reducing
the coupling and dependencies of the application's Model component.
** Cons: However, rebuilding a new but completed `TriviaTest` would be tedious and complicated. Hence, `TriviaResult` is
needed separate the complexities that are involved in data collection and the actual implementation of `TriviaTest`.
// end::triviatest[]

// tag::matchtest[]
=== MatchTest Feature
==== Current Implementation
This feature is facilitated by the `AppState` and `MatchTest` model.

The `AppState` model defines the state of which the application is in. And the `MatchTest` model is a subclass of
`TriviaTest`.

Additionally, `MatchTest` also implements the following operations:

* `MatchTest#startTest()` -- Does the necessary initialisations to start a `MatchTest`.
* `MatchTest#stopTest()` -- Does the necessary clean up to stop a `MatchTest`.
* `MatchTest#match(questionIndex, answerIndex)` -- Matches the question to the answer.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#startTriviaTest()`, `Model#stopTriviaTest()` and `Model#MatchQuestionAndAnswer` respectively.

The following activity diagram shows the complete lifecycle of a `MatchTest`.

image::MatchTestActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

The sequence below is an example scenario and how the `MatchTest` behaves at each step.

Step 1. User enters the `testM` command and a new `MatchTestCommand` will be created and executed, triggering a
string of events as shown in the sequence diagram below.

image::StartingMatchTestSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. After the `MatchTest` has been started, the user can only input the following commands:

* `QUESTION_INDEX ANSWER_INDEX` Will be used to specify which question will be matched to the specified answer.
* `ANSWER_INDEX` Another way to match the question (at the top of the question list) to its specified answer.
* `exit` If the user input `exit` during a `MatchTest`, the `MatchTest` will end and the information related to that `MatchTest` will not be recorded.

Step 3. Suppose the user choose to match a question to an answer, a list of steps will be executed as shown in the sequence
diagram below.

image::MatchCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 4. If there are still existing unmatched questions and answers, the System will go back to step 3.

Step 5. After all the question and answers are matched, the System will store the results on the hard disk and display the test's result.

Step 6. At this stage, the System will await `exit` command from the user so that user can be taken back to the test menu page.

==== Design Considerations

===== UI related considerations during a MatchTest
* Below are the different aspect of the UI in the `MatchTest` that have been considered.
** The UI feedback that are involved after the execution of `MatchCommand`
*** Due to the possibility of having to match a lot of questions and answers, after each successful match, the question and answer
that are matched correctly will be removed. In addition, to improve user experience, a colored flash will be flashed
before their removal.
** The Index of the question and answer
*** The index of the question and answer is important because the user would be using it to identify which question is to be
matched to which answer. The easy way to do this was to let `ListView` do it's job of re-indexing whenever an item is removed.
However, doing so will cause confusion to the user as the index that is used to represent an item is now used to represent another item.
Hence, in `MatchTest`, we have made the Indexes static.
** The commands involved in matching
*** The basic way for the user to matching a question to an answer is for them to provide the Index of the question and answer.
However, when the list of questions and answers are long, the user will have problem keeping track of 2 lists. Hence, an
alternative way is to require the user just key in the Index of the answer, and 3VIA will match the first question in the list
to that specified answer. This is more intuitive because the user just need to scroll through the answer list,
allowing user to focus on finding the answer to match the first question.

===== The static display indexes of the ListView for question and answer
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Created new classes namely, `IndexedQuestion` and `IndexedAnswer` to uniquely identify the cells in `ListView`.
** Pros: Finding the exact question and answer is easy as what the user see is a representative of the Id that identifies the question/answer.
** Cons: Currently, the classes created are for the sole purpose of having static display indexes during `MatchTest`.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a `List` of mapping that maps the actual index to the display index of the question and answer.
** Cons: Additional work is required to maintain the `List` data structure, to ensure that it is updated every time a question or answer is removed from the UI. +
In addition, The questions and answers are displayed using `ListView`, and since the mapping of actual index to display index is not an attribute to the question/answer,
the mapping needs to be passed into the UI component. This mapping will then be used by the constructor of `ListView` to
create a static display index of question and answer. Hence, this design consideration was not implemented due to
abstraction that is leaking into the UI.
// end::matchtest[]

// tag::openendedtest[]
=== Open Ended Test

==== Current Implementation
The implementation of an OpenEndedTest is facilitated by the `AppState` and `OpenEndedTest` model.

The `AppState` model defines the state of which the application is in, and that will affect the type of interactions the user can have with the program. The `OpenEndedTest` model is a subclass of
`TriviaTest`.

Additionally, `OpenEndedTest` also implements the following operations:

* `OpenEndedTest#startTest()` -- Does the necessary initialisations to start a OpenEndedTest.
* `OpenEndedTest#stopTest()` -- Does the necessary clean up to stop a OpenEndedTest.
* `OpenEndedTest#recordAnswer(userInput)` -- Records the user's answer to a question.
* `OpenEndedTest#addAttempt(userInput)` -- Records the user's input of whether an attempt is correct, and stores it together with the user's answer into an Attempt.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#startTriviaTest()`, `Model#stopTriviaTest()`, `recordAnswerToOpenEndedTest` and `isOpenEndedTestAnswerCorrect` respectively.

The following activity diagram shows the complete lifecycle of a OpenEndedTest.

image::OpenEndedTestActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the OpenEndedTest behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enter theOpenEndedTest_ActivityDiagram `testO` command and a new `OpenEndedTestCommand` will be created.

Step 2. The `OpenEndedTestCommand` will be executed and a new OpenEndedTest Object will be created as shown in the below Sequence diagram.

image::OpenEndedCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. After the OpenEndedTest has been started, the user can only input the following commands:

* `USER_INPUT` Will be the user's answer to the question. It can be a blank line. [During Question State (Question is shown, waiting for user answer)]]
* `IS_ANSWER_CORRECT` The user will indicate if the question was answered correctly. [During Answer State (Answer is shown, waiting for correctness)]
* `exit` If the user input `exit`, the OpenEndedTest will end and the information related to that OpenEndedTest will not be recorded.

Step 4. When the user answers a question, the sequence will execute a list of steps, as shown in the sequence diagram below, to determine record the answer and display the correct answer.

image::OpenEndedAnswerCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 5. The user will now compare the user supplied answer with the card answer and manually indicate if the user supplied answer is correct. The sequence wull execute a list of steps, as show in the sequence diagram below, to record the card, user answer and correctness into an attempt and display the next question.

image::OpenEndedCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. After all cards have been answered, the System will store the results on the hard disk and display the test's result.

Step 7. At this stage, the System will await `exit` command from the user so that user can be taken back to the home page.


==== Design Considerations

===== Deciding correctness of user answer
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display the correct answer as well as user answer, and let the user decide if the answer is correct.
** Pros: Flexible on the user side, easier to implement as there is no need for keywords that has to be supplied when importing cards to determine correctness when compared with user answer.
** Cons: User determines the correctness, so it not a rigid system.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a `List` of keywords that must be in user answer for it to be correct
** Cons: Additional work is required to determine the keywords when the cards are imported, as well as in parsing and comparing the user answer with the keywords to determine correctness.

// tag::NavigationTabCommands[]
=== Navigation Feature
==== Current Implementation
The Navigation Tab is designed for users to be aware of the different functionality of our app and paired with its relevant content.
We added a navigation tab feature which can be accessed through commands of the tabs the user wants to navigate to.

The contents of the each AppState, or the functionalities of that page is attached to the tab itself, to allow the user to check and use the app more efficiently.
Commands and mouse click events will handle the updating of AppState.

.Toggle Tab Event
image::ToggleTabActivityDiagram.png[width="1000"]

==== Handling event
At the present, the Navigation Tab is not a separate class on its own, and is embedded into the `MainDisplay` class.
Event raised is ToggleTabEvent.

===== GUI Handling
The tabs are expected to toggle and display their respective tab contents according to the user's interaction:

* Commands from Command Line Interface
* Mouse clicks
* Keyboard shortcuts [future release]

==== Design Considerations
===== Location of Navigation tab
* Side bar
** pros: easy to see, optimized for user experience
** cons: harder to implement

* Top bar (_currently implemented_)
** pros: easier to implement
** cons: less visually intuitive for users compared to side bar

==== Using external library
Originally we were using JFoenix, however due to a bug which causes the alignment of our pages to the tabs to be visually off,
we decided to implement a regular tab.

* Library used: https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix[JFoenix]
* Tutorial inspiration: http://synappse.co/blog/vertical-stateful-jfxtabpane-with-icons-in-javafx/[Vertical Tabs]

===== Icons on the Tabs
We have added the icon images for the tabs, but implementation is still a work in progress.
// end::NavigationTabCommands[]

// tag::ModeCommand[]
=== Day and Night Mode Feature
==== Current Implementation
Mode allows you to toggle between day and night mode anywhere in the app and it can be accessed as a command in any AppState of 3VIA.

.Day Mode / Light Theme
image::3VIATheme.png[width="800"]

.Night Mode / Dark Theme
image::DarkTheme.png[width="800"]

.Mode activity diagram
image::ModeActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Handling event
Event is handled in the `MainWindow.java`.

==== GUI Handling
The default of the application is a "Day Theme" stylesheet, meaning a generally white background
with dark text. The command will swap the current theme set to a "Dark Theme" stylesheet.
Each time the the `mode` command is called, the boolean in `MainDisplay.java` acts as a toggle between the 2 themes.
// end::ModeCommand[]

// tag::deleteMultiple[]
=== [Proposed] Delete Multiple `Coming in v2.0`
==== Current Implementation
The delete mechanism is facilitated by `TriviaBundleParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, `ParserUtil`, `DeleteCommand` and `Index`.

Currently, `DeleteCommandParser` invokes `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` which parses a `oneBasedIndex` input into an `Index`.
The `DeleteCommand` executes the deletion of a card using the `zeroBasedIndex` as specified in `Index`.

==== Proposed Enhancement
To delete a range of cards from 1 to 5, `delete 1-5` will be executed.
The proposed deletion of multiple cards will utilise the following operations:

* `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` -- takes in a one based index.
* `ParserUtil#parseMultipleIndex()` -- takes in a range of one based indexes in a specified format.

Both of the above methods will return a set of `Index`.

Given below is an example implementation of how `delete 1-5` will behave at each step.

Step 1. `DeleteCommandParser` will determine if the given input deletes a single card or multiple cards.
This can be done by determining if the input contains a `-`.

Step 2. In this example, `ParserUtil#parseMultipleIndex()` will execute and return a set of `Index`.

Step 3. The set of `Index` is used to initialise `DeleteCommand`.

Step 4. When `DeleteCommand#execute()` is invoked. A zero based index is obtained from each `Index` in the set.
Each zero based index is then used to delete the cards, similar to the current implementation of `delete`.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Separate or single delete command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Single delete command.
** Pro: Reduces the number of commands for the user to remember.
** Con: Users may be unaware of this functionality being available
as the name of the command does not describe deleting multiple cards.
* **Alternative 2:** Separate delete command for deleting multiple cards.
** Pro: The command will describe the action of deleting multiple cards clearly (i.e. `deleteMultiple 1-5`).
** Con: There will be more commands for the user to remember.

// end::deleteMultiple[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
