By: `CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-3`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.jxmusic.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-3 branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-3/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-3/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

// tag::ArchitectureDiagram_david[]
.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
// end::ArchitectureDiagram_david[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-Player,*`Player`*>>: Interacts with the audio interface.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
// tag::eventDrivenandUI[]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `playlist del 1`.

.Component interactions for `playlist del 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePlaylist.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `LibraryChangedEvent` when the library data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `playlist del 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePlaylistEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jxmusic/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `TrackListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/jxmusic/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

// end::eventDrivenandUI[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `LibraryParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a playlist) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("playlist del 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `playlist del 1` Command
image::LogicComponentSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Library data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Track>` and `ObservableList<Playlist>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/jxmusic/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the library data in json format and read it back.

// tag::DesignPlayerComponent_david[]
[[Design-Player]]
=== Player component

.Structure of the Player Component
image::PlayerClassDiagram.png[width="400"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/jxmusic/player/Player.java[`Player.java`]

The `Player` component,

* interfaces with JavaFX Media to play sounds
* handles media control with mp3 files

// end::DesignPlayerComponent_david[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.jxmusic.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::ImplementationPlayerComponent_david[]
=== Player Component
==== Current Implementation

The Player component is a new component in addition to the existing 4 other components of AddressBook. It handles all audio related functionalities for some of the Command classes to use. Player mainly interacts with the JavaFX media library that is included in Java, so no third party library is involved.

The job of the Player is basically forwarding requests of media playback controls to the Playable object.

===== Singleton Player
Player is implemented as a singleton as only one instance of it is required at any time. While singleton brings about undesired implications such as tighter coupling and lower testability, we ensured that Player is only used by the Command classes and no other parts of the code touches Player. As for testability, we discover that JUnit is not compatible for JavaFX media (details in <<Notable-Issues-JavaFXMedia>>). On the plus side, singleton pattern makes adding dependency very easy which is very helpful as adding dependency into the Logic component of Address Book was tedious.

.Player component complete class diagram
image::PlayerCompleteClassDiagram.png[width="600"]

[[PlayableStatus]]
===== PlayableStatus
`PlayableStatus` to represents the state of the player, effectively acts as a layer on top of JavaFX’s `MediaPlayer.Status`.

1. `UNINITIALIZED` - The initial state when no track or playlist has been played
2. `PLAYING` - User enters either the `play p/` or `play t/` command
3. `PAUSED` - User enters the `pause` command
4. `STOPPED` - User enters the `stop` command
5. `ERROR` - Any other states of the `MediaPlayer.Status` which JxMusic is not concerned with

.`PlayableStatus` state chart diagram
image::PlayableStatusStateChartDiagram.png[width="300"]

[[Skipped-Tests]]
===== Skipped Tests

JUnit and JavaFX MediaPlayer does not work well together. Running any test that constructs a MediaPlayer object (ie `new MediaPlayer`) will throw `IllegalStateException: Toolkit not initialized`. In order to resolve the exception, it requires calling `Platform.startup()` before `new MediaPlayer` is called. Even so, the tests will not work on Travis nor Appveyor, throwing `MediaException: Cannot create player!` thus failing the builds. It is suspected to be due to incompatibility or lack of support for JavaFX Media on their test servers since JavaFX Media has its own link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/downloads/supportedconfigurations-1506746.html[dependencies (at the bottom of link)].

Therefore, any test that depends on MediaPlayer are skipped by using `Assume.assumeNoException(mediaException)`.

[[Notable-Issues-JavaFXMedia]]
===== Notable Issues with JavaFX Media

1. JavaFX Media does not work for mp3 files that has photoshopped album art. +
* This issue has been reported as a link:https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8210828[confirmed Java bug].
2. Playing a track on MacOS requires setting the MediaPlayer current time to 0 before calling `play()` as it jumps to the end of media for no reason. Whereas on Windows, calling `MediaPlayer.play` works.
* This issue is addressed at link:{repoUrl}/issues/35[#35].

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Choice of media player library
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use JavaFX Media API
** Pros:
*** No additional dependency (link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/downloads/supportedconfigurations-1506746.html[at least on common operating systems])
** Cons:
*** See <<Skipped-Tests>>

* **Alternative 2:** Use 3rd party mp3 player library such as JLayer
** Pros:
*** Possibly less issues than JavaFX Media.
** Cons:
*** Additional dependency
*** Existing mp3 libraries for java are old and badly documented.

// end::ImplementationPlayerComponent_david[]

// tag::ReadLibrary[]
=== ReadLibrary
==== Current Implementation
The `readLibrary` is a part of `JsonLibraryStorage`. It reads the Json file as well as the library folder when initialising the `library` class. It calls the following operations:

* `JsonFileStorage.loadDataFromFile(filepath)` - deserialize the Json file and create `library` class.
* `Trackscanner.scan(libraryDir)` - scan through the library folder and fill all the valid mp3 files into a set of tracks.

No matter whether the Json file exists, `trackscanner` will run first to make sure the `library` class contains the tracks set. Then if the file path exists, it will deserialize the json file to initialize library’s playlist information. The deserializer and serializer are programmed with `Gson` library. +

The `trackscanner` navigates to the library folder and extracts the mp3 files and add them to the set of tracks. However there are cases that the user does not have a library folder in the same directory as the app. To ensure the tracks contained inside the playlist to be valid and navigable, we put a library folder containing default tracks inside the resources folder.
Hence, the program first extracts the library folder from the jar file and copy it to the directory. There are two methods that the app copies library to the directory:

* Case 1: If the MainApp is run using jar file, `trackscanner` will internally run the unzip command to unzip the jar file. (Warning: This only works if the jar file is opened using Terminal);
* Case 2: If the MainApp is run using IDE, `trackscanner` will copy the library folder from resources to the directory;

.Activity of trackscanner
image::TrackScannerActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Choice of media player library
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Read the Json file from data folder and scan the tracks from library folder at the same time.
** Pros:
*** Enables the library to initialise with all the available tracks in library folder
** Cons:
*** The track treeset in the library class will not update again after initialisation.

* **Alternative 2:** Do not scan the tracks in `readLibrary`, scan the library each time the user search for tracks in the library folder.
** Pros:
*** Lead to the files’ latest status inside the library folder

==== Future Enhancements

When the user double clicks the jar file it cannot run because the unzipping of jar file is done using `process.exec`, which requires the user to run the jar file using terminal. This needs to be addressed in future development.
// end::ReadLibrary[]

// tag::Tracksearchandlist[]
=== Track search and Track list
==== Current Implementation
The `tracklist` and `tracksearch` commands are implemented to view and filter tracks in the library.

* `Command.TrackListCommand` - list all the tracks inside the library
* `Command.TrackSearchCommand` - search the desired tracks from library whose name contains any of the argument keywords.

.Sequence of track list command
image::TrackListCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

.Activity of track search command
image::TrackSearchCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Searching multiple keywords.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Combines each search results by each keywords separated by space.
** Pros:
*** Find tracks that match with any of the keywords
** Cons:
*** Spaces are not included in the keywords.
* **Alternative 2:** consider words as one part of the desired track and show results of the search.
** Pros:
*** Show more precise results

===== Aspect: Tracks listed display
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** List the tracks in a new panel separate from playlist panel.
** Pros:
*** Tracks are more clearly shown.
* **Alternative 2:** Show the tracks in the message box
** Pros:
*** Easier to implement.
** Cons:
*** Takes up the message box and hence the success message or failing message cannot be seen.

==== Future Enhancements
Future development can combine the two alternatives so that the user can search with keywords including spaces when they intend to.
// end::Tracksearchandlist[]

// tag::Trackaddandremove[]
=== Track Adding and Removing Feature
Simple-to-use track management commands that add tracks to a specified playlist.

==== Current Implementation
When managing a playlist, you can customise it by adding and removing tracks from it.

.Sequence diagram: track add command
image::TrackAddCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="720"]

.Activity diagram: track add command
image::TrackAddCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="720"]

.Sequence diagram: track delete command
image::TrackDeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="720"]

==== Design Considerations
To add new tracks to a playlist can be a very mechanical task, hence the ease of allowing for adding multiple entries helps to ease the need for repetition. It also makes sense for the inclusion of adding tracks by referring to its index on the panel.

Hence, there are two ways that tracks can be added.
Firstly, with track name.
Secondly, with its index from filteredTrackList panel.

The omission of repeating the index prefix is also added to reduce typing required to perform deletion. Having to type the prefix with every index means including up to 200% more typing per index to add.

Deleting tracks does not support deletion in multiples, and it omits the need for index prefix.

While tracks can be added by name, it makes sense to allow the user to make case-insensitive references to tracks. This helps to reduce the need to follow case convention for track names.

==== Future Enhancements
Deleting multiple tracks could be implemented as more advanced features are added.

Adding multiple tracks by substrings can be implemented to facilitate quick modification of playlists.
// end::Trackaddandremove[]

=== Playback Feature
Four functionalities are implemented to achieve the playback task in JxMusic Player. `play` enables users to play musics. `pause` allows the break off of playing and `stop` terminates playing. `seek` functionality achieves the requirement of seeking the playing to a certain time point. To aid the use of `seek`, `duration` command is implemented to let users get the duration of track.

// tag::ImplementationPlaybackFeaturePlay_david[]
==== Play
PlayCommand caters for commands having the word `play` in it, in particular, `play`, `play p/` and `play t/` commands. It consists of 5 modes:

1. Continue from pause - `play`
2. Default playlist - `play p/`
3. Specific playlist - `play p/<playlist name>`
4. Default track - `play t/`
5. Specific track - `play t/<track name>`

These modes are determined by the different PlayCommand constructors called by the PlayCommandParser after it parses the user input, as shown in the activity diagram below:

.Play command activity diagram
image::PlayCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="600"]

Playing a playlist constructs a PlayablePlaylist which is essentially playing a list of PlayableTrack. The currently playing track is pointed by the `currentIndex`.

image::PlayablePlaylistObjectDiagram1.png[width="600"]

When a track finishes playing, the next track is played.

image::PlayablePlaylistObjectDiagram2.png[width="600"]

Future enhancement: implement `prev()` for playing the previous track.

image::PlayablePlaylistObjectDiagram3.png[width="600"]
// end::ImplementationPlaybackFeaturePlay_david[]

===== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Initialization stage of PlayablePlaylist
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Constructs a list of PlayableTrack
** Pros:
*** Better performance when switching tracks
*** Easier implementation
** Cons:
*** Does not cater for playlist changes when it is playing (ie adding/deleting a track while the playlist is playing)
* **Alternative 2:** Constructs PlayableTrack only when it is to be played
** Pros:
*** Caters for playlist changes
** Cons:
*** Slightly worse performance
*** More complex implementation

// tag::playbackFeature_yingnan[]
==== Pause
`PauseCommand` is implemented to realize the pausing a playing entity.
The playing could be resumed after pause and it will play from the time point at which the playing entity is paused.
Ultimately, `pause()` method in `javafx.scene.media.MediaPlayer` is being called to achieve the performance.

==== Stop
`StopCommand` is implemented to achieve the termination of playing of a playing entity.
The playing could not be resumed after `stop`, but the entity being played is remembered and `play` command
after `stop` will result in the playing of the entity from the beginning.
Ultimately, `stop()` method in `javafx.scene.media.MediaPlayer` is being called to achieve the performance.

.Sequence of the `stop` command
image::StopSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Seek
===== Current Implementation
The `seek` functionality enables user to seek the play of a track to a certain time point.
This feature is achieved by the implementation of `SeekCommand` in logic class.
To perform user’s instruction, `SeekCommandParser` is also being implemented. Ultimately, `seek(Duration seekTime)`
method in `javafx.scene.media.MediaPlayer` is being called to achieve the performance.

===== Design Consideration
===== Aspect:  How seek behaves when the time point is beyond start/stop(aka. total) time
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** throws exception with error message

.Activity of `seek`
image::SeekMethodActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]
** Pro:
*** User will get notification message if their intention could not be achieved
** Con:
*** Exception will be thrown and the duration information should be made clear to users.

* **Alternative 2:** follows the specification of `seek(Duration seekTime)` in `javafx.scene.media.MediaPlayer` +
In the documentation of `javafx.scene.media.MediaPlayer.seek(Duration seekTime)`, it specifies the following execution results: +
If seekTime > stop time, seek to stop time. +
If seekTime < start time, seek to start time.

** Pro:
*** No extra implementation of the retrieval of duration information needs to be done.
** Con:
*** User will not get notification message if their intention of seeking to a point out of playing time fails.

==== Duration
===== Current Implementation
`DurationCommand` is implemented to enable users to know the duration of current playing track/paused/stopped track.
A message contains the duration of the track will displayed in `ResultDisplay` of the `MainWindow`.

===== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: How user get to know the duration of a track
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** implements a command to retrieve the information of duration
** Pro:
*** User will have the control of the display of the duration information.
** Con:
*** Compare with Alternative 2, it is less user friendly since extra effort is needed for users
to get the information of duration.

* **Alternative 2:** displays the duration of tracks in `trackCard`

.Proposed UI design with duration shown
image::UIwithDuration.png[width="800"]

This choice is what we chose at first, but subsequently we find out the some methods could not be tested due to the
backwardness of javafx (Travis and AppVeyor throw `com.sun.media.jfxmedia.mediaexception: could not create player!`
exception while local tests pass)

** Pro:
*** It is more convenient and intuitive since no extra effort need to be made to get to know the duration information.
** Con:
*** `javafx` feature might be an obstacle when testing.

// end::playbackFeature_yingnan[]

// tag::playlistNew_hayden[]
=== Playlist Management feature
==== Current Implementation

Playlist new - Creates a new playlist which is added to the library +
Playlist del - Deletes the playlist indexed displayed on the playlist panel from the library +
Playlist search - Searches through the library and displays the playlist/s that match the desired String/ sub-String +
Playlist list - Lists all playlists within the library

The PlaylistNewCommand creates a new Playlist that is added to the Library object if it does not exists. It’s command phrase pattern is `playlist new p/playlist [t/track]...` where `playlist` denotes the name of the playlist and `track` denotes the name of the tracks.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

Pattern:
`playlist new p/playlist [t/track]...`
Example:
`playlist new p/Favourites t/Somesong t/Othersong`

If no tracks are specified, an empty playlist will be created. Otherwise, the list of tracks will be automatically added into the playlist.

The PlaylistNewCommandParser handles parsing of the user input, specifically for the mandatory playlist name as well as the optional track list.

If there exists a playlist in the library with the same name as the new playlist, it will be rejected from being added into the library as playlist is identified by its name.

The following sequence diagram shows how a new playlist is added:

image::playlistNewCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::PlaylistNewActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How tracks are added to a new playlist

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** When adding tracks to a new playlist - Identify the tracks by full track name.
** Pros: Easy to implement and intuitive for the user.
** Cons: Tracks with long name could take a long time to type.
* **Alternative 2:** Identify the track via index within the track List panel.
** Pros: Can be much faster to add tracks
** Cons: If panel List is large, it could take a long time to find track

===== Aspect: Data structure to support adding a Playlist

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** New playlists are added to the bottom of the Library.
** Pros: Keeps the most recent / relevant playlists at the highest playlist index number.
** Cons: Hard to find playlist when Library contains a large amount of playlists.
* **Alternative 2:** Playlists are displayed in alphabetical order
** Pros: Easier to find desired playlist within large list.
** Cons: Harder to find recently added playlists
* **Alternative 3:** New playlists display at the top of the playlist panel.
** Pros: Keeps the most recent / relevant playlists at the top and easily accessible.
** Cons: Has larger compute time cost when list is large
// end::playlistNew_hayden[]



// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.jxmusic.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.jxmusic.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.jxmusic.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.jxmusic.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

Positive [green]#test cases# (for normal usage scenario) are in green and negative [red]#test cases# (for usage scenarios trying to break the app) are in red.

=== Launch

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Open the terminal/command prompt/powershell
.. Enter command `java -jar jxmusic.jar` +
   Expected: a “library” folder to be generated next to the jar file and shows GUI with sample playlists (as shown below)
... Fallback 1: enter command `unzip jxmusic.jar "library/*"` then double click the jar file
... Fallback 2: download and unzip link:{repoUrl}/releases/download/v1.3/library.zip[library.zip] in the folder containing the jar file, then double click the jar file

image::LibraryFolderNextToJar.png[width="300"]

image::Ui.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Once library folder exists and it contains the sample mp3 files, subsequent launches can be done by double clicking the jar file.

. Add mp3 files into the library
.. [green]#Test case:# Copy and paste any of the mp3 file in the library folder, then run the jar file. +
Expected: The new track file name appears in the track panel.

. Add invalid mp3 file into the library
.. [red]#Test case:# Save a text file as "invalid.mp3" in the library folder, then run the jar file. +

.. [red]#Test case:# `stop` +
Expected: Displays "no track to stop" error message.

=== Viewing duration of track

[NOTE]
Due to a limitation of the media player library, duration of a track can only be made known once it starts playing.

. View duration of a playing/paused/stopped track
.. [green]#Test case:# `play p/`, `duration` +
Expected: Displays duration of the currently playing track.
.. [green]#Test case:# `play p/`, `pause`, `duration` +
Expected: Displays duration of the currently playing track.
.. [green]#Test case:# `play p/`, `stop`, `duration` +
