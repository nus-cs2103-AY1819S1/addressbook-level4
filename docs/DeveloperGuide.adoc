== Value Proposition

Current: +

* `Tutors use reminder applications to keep track of lessons`
* `Tutors use physical diaries or notepads to keep track of current lesson progress`

Value:

* `Tutors have a platform where they can keep track of all their students' details, their progress and the syllabus they intend to cover.`

== User Stories

. As a busy tutor, I want to be able to manage my students' schedules individually, so that I can plan my time properly.
. As a tutor, I want to be able to find out where my students live and what time I should be there for tuition.
. As a tutor, I want to know my students' individual progress so that I know what topics I need to cover for the next tuition session.
. As a tutor, I want to keep track of my students' payments.

      2b2. System filters out students with tuition before current date.
      2b3. Resume from step 3.

  6. Record students' payments

    System: TutorHelper
    Actor: Tutor
    Precondition: student index entered must be valid.
    MSS:
      1. Tutor request to add in payment for a student.
      2. System searches for that student according to index entered.
      3. System adds Payment amount, month and year to student's record.
      4. System displays payment record in browser panel.
      5. System displays successful recording of payment under command box.

     Actor: Tutor
     Precondition: Tutor has recorded payment from students before.
     MSS:
        1. Tutor request for earnings for a specific month and year.
        2. System searches for all the payment records made from all the students for that particular month and year.
        3. System adds up all the payment.
        4. System displays total earnings under the command box.
     Extensions:
        2a. System does not find any payment recorded for that month and year.
            2a1. System displays $0 as result.

== Non-Functional Requirements

. The system should respond in two seconds.
. The system should be understandable to a novice in working with computers.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::group[]
=== Group Students feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the group mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. Assuming that the application isn't empty, the user executes 'group Monday' command to group all students with a class on Monday. The group command will be called by `GroupCommandParser.parse()`, parsing the argument to check against. The application will check the list and display all students with classes on Monday, sorted based on the earliest timing.

[NOTE]
The user can execute `list` to re-display the full list of students again.

The following sequence diagram shows how the group operation works:

// tag::copysub[]
=== Copy Subject feature
==== Current Implementation

The copy subject command operates by making a duplicate of the selected subject of the student and adds it the other student.

[NOTE]
If the other student already has the same subject, append the content of the subject instead. State of each syllabus is also copied.

Classes related to copy command and its functionality are listed below:

* `AddressBookParser` -- Creates CopySubCommandParser which parses the input from user.
* `CopySubCommandParser` -- Parses user's input into proper argument and creates CopySubCommand
* `CopySubCommand` -- Updates the target person based on the argument
* `SubjectsUtil` -- Manage the finding and copying aspect of copysub command.

Given below is an example usage scenario with 2 possible outcomes and how to copy function addresses each case.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. Assuming that the application isn't empty, the user executes `copysub 1 2 4`.

Step 3. Assuming that each argument given is a valid input, the system will perform the copysub command.

Step 4. The system will locate the _first_ student from the student list, and make a separate copy of the _second_ subject stored under the student data.

Step 5. The system will locate the _fourth_ student from the student list, and make a decision.

* Step 5a. If the same subject as _second_ subject in Step 4, system will append the content of subject of _second_ subject into the _fourth_ student.
* Step 5b. If there is no subject same as _second_ subject in Step 4, system will add the _second_ subject as a new subject under the _fourth_ student.

The process is described with sequence diagram below:

== Glossary
. Subject : a branch of knowledge studied by the student
. Syllabus: the required topics to be covered under the subject
