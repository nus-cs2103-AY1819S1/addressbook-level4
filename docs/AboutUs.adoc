CAPTracker is for those students who prefer to use a desktop app for calculating and managing their CAP. More importantly CAPTracker is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CAPTracker is the ideal application to calculate your current CAP, and predict what grades you need in modules you havenâ€™t taken to achieve your ideal CAP. +
