== Overview

'Ren' in Mandarin translates to 'person' or 'people', and true to our name, this app is all about managing one’s network of clients in an organized, efficient and intuitive manner. InsuRen is geared to the needs of the modern Insurance salesman, but anyone whose business is their strong rapport with their clients will find this to be an indispensable tool.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=denzelchung[Project Code Dashboard]
* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to upload picture*
** What it does: allows the user to add a picture for his clients.
** Justification: This feature improves the usability and convenience of the product as the user can now identify his clients by their picture. In the event where the user has two clients of similar names, this feature can help the user identify their identities by looking at their picture and not make the mistake of calling the wrong person.
** Highlights: This enhancement added a new command. It required knowledge on path validation and handling the different platform's path format to make the program run on any mainstream OS.
** Credits: _rongjiecomputer_ for his suggestion on using `Guava` on the https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/forum/issues/115[forum].

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Loads a default picture if no picture is specified.
