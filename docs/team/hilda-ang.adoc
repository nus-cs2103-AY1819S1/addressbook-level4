== PROJECT: ModulePlanner

== Overview

This project portfolio showcases the contributions I have made in a team project under the module *CS2103T: Software Engineering*. I worked in a team of four Computer Science students to develop a product named *ModulePlanner*, which is built on top of an existing software (AddressBook - Level 4).

*ModulePlanner* is a desktop application made to help Computer Science and Computer Engineering students in National University of Singapore plan their modules for their entire candidature periods. It is designed to be used mainly through a Command Line Interface (CLI), although it also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The main features include:

** Suggesting available modules based on major requirements and modules' prerequisites.
** Adding and deleting modules to or from the planner.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_Given below are enhancements I implemented for the product and other contributions I made to the team. They showcase my abilities in software engineering and in working with a team._
|===

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *suggest available modules to the user*
** What it does: allows the user to see the modules he/she is available to take in each semester, based on the modules he/she has added to the planner.
** Justification: This feature helps the user plan modules by generating and listing available modules.
** Highlights: This is the main feature of our application. It required a careful consideration of several design alternatives and implementation choices. The implementation was challenging as it interacted with various components and other commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the ability to *list modules that the user has taken*
** What it does: allows user to see the modules he/she has added to all years or to a specific year.
** Justifications: This feature helps the user to quickly check what module(s) he/she has added to the planner.
