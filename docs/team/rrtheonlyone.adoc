== Overview

I am a year 2 Computer Science Student studying at National University of Singapore. I am
interested in using technology to solve everyday problems and am always on the lookout for
any challenging project to work with. This portfolio page serves to document my work on FoodZoom.


== Project: FoodZoom

FoodZoom is a desktop application allowing users to streamline their delivery process. The application is
specifically targeted towards food businesses who need an efficient way to manage their delivery services.
FoodZoom uses a Command-Line Interface, meaning users can simply make use of keyword based commands when running the
application. The application was built by a team of 5 students including myself.

FoodZoom's *core functionality* includes:

- Users being able to track food orders (visualise on a map) they have from customers
- Managing deliverymen and assigning orders to them
- Analysis of orders to display relevant statistics (order history, trending food etc.) to users

== Summary of Contributions

|The below sections showcase some of the contributions that I made to this application.

--
* *Major enhancement:* Built the system that allows for the *generation of statistics* and *location-based matching*
based off the provided data (Pull Request
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-3/main/pull/102[#102],
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-3/main/pull/121[#121])

** What it does: The main screen consists of a map and a dashboard. The map is able to show the number of pending
orders at a region. The dashboard shows statistics like the most popular food item and the order history

** Justification: Users of this application can track where their pending orders are in one glance. Orders in the
same region can now be dispatched to the same deliveryman. Users can also use the generated statistics to improve their
profits and improve the overall experience they can provide to their customers

* *Major enhancement:* Completely *revamped* and *redesigned* the User Interface (UI) for the application
(Pull Request
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-3/main/pull/102[#73],
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-3/main/pull/128[#128],
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-3/main/pull/171[#171]
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-3/main/pull/183[#183])

** What it does: Users of this application have a visually appealing interface. They are able to view
the status of their orders, available deliverymen and key insights for their data all in one screen.

** Justification: The UI is minimalistic and was designed with the end-user in mind. There is only one screen that
the user uses at all times and all essential details are on that screen. The UI updates itself based on the
actions of the user e.g. the map/dashboard will dynamically update when there is a change.

* *Minor enhancements*:

** Added essential fields such as address and date to order model
