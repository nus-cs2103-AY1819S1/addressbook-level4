== PROJECT: NUS Hangs

---

== Overview

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
** created a timetable class in person and did features: +
*** add_timetable : adds a timetable csv file to a person.
*** delete_timetable : delete timetable in person and replace it with a default timetable, delete timetable csv file in the person stored folder if there is 1.
*** download_timetable : download timetable as a csv file to a folder
*** edit_timetable : edit the timetable details of a person.

** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can know his contacts schedule, and can share his timetable easily with others.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and knowledge of how to get data from csv file in java.
