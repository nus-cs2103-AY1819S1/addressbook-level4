== PROJECT: Makan Book

---

== Overview

Makan Book is a restaurant guide and application for diners in National University of Singapore (NUS). It allows users to write and view
reviews for restaurants within NUS. Additionally, Users are able to interact with one another to create a more enjoyable experience.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major Enhancement*: The Storage of User Data in a *separate file*
** What it does: Any data relating to User such as friends, jios, timetable and schedule are all stored in a separate file called Users.xml
** Justification: The separation of data allows the ease of maintenance and extraction of data.

* *Major Enhancement*: added *the ability to leave a review for a restaurant*
** What it does: It allows a user leave a rating and review for a restaurant. The user's review will adjust the overall rating of the particular restaurant given that it is an averaged score.
** Justification: This feature allows a user to view all the reviews written for a particular restaurant. A more informed decision can be made. The user can also see all the reviews previously given as a record of the restaurants he visited.
** Highlights: This enhancement was challenging to implement because it had to store the review in both the User Data and Restaurant AddressBook.

* *Minor Enhancement*: added *the ability for a User to create an account*
** What it does: Allows a User to create an account to interact with the application.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now create an account to join the network of users. The ability to have accounts allows for various functionality such as adding friends, creating Jios and more.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. For instance, only users who are logged in should be able to interact with one another.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a displayProfile command that allows the user to view all the data that is related to him. This includes his own personal information and the reviews he has made.
