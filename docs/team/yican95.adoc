== PROJECT: MeNUS

This portfolio serves as a summary of my contributions for https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-4/main[MeNUS].

== Overview

*MeNUS* is an all-in-one restaurant management desktop application developed to help restaurant owners
and managers streamline the process of managing restaurants. It allows the restaurant owners and managers to control
their inventory, menu, sales and reservations efficiently all-in-one place.
*MeNUS* is also designed to help restaurants save cost from running expensive and independent systems.

Restaurant owners interact with *MeNUS* using a Command Line Interface
(CLI). It also has a Graphical User Interface(GUI) created with https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/[JavaFX]. *MeNUS* is
 written using https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html[Java 9] with
approximately 30 KLOC.

== Summary of Contributions
* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=yican95[RepoSense]

* *Major enhancement*: Added *Menu Management* feature
** *What it does*: Enables the user to manage the menus with the various menu management commands.
** *Justification*: It can be messy and tedious to manage menus manually. This feature helps users to
streamline the process of managing menus by enabling them to modify the menus efficiently
with just a single command.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement integrates with some existing sales and ingredients management commands.
It requires an in-depth analysis and understanding of *MeNUS* architecture to ensure that commands of each management
 feature is integrated properly together.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added animation to the GUI
(Pull request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-4/main/pull/214[#214])
** *What it does*: Plays the https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/animation/FadeTransition.html[FadeTransition]
for a short duration when the user enters a command.
