== PROJECT: CLInic

---

== Overview

This project portfolio presents my contributions towards this project, including the features implemented, technologies used and documentation written.

This project was undertaken during a software engineering module (CS2103T) offered in National University of Singapore (NUS).
The objective of this project was to enhance a given 'address book' application by adding more features, tests, and to apply the software engineering practices that we are taught during the module.

My team decided to morph the address book application into a clinic management system.

Aptly named 'CLInic', it focuses on optimising efficiency for its users through the use of a Command Line Interface (hence the 'CLI' in 'CLInic').
With a CLI, users will have to navigate the application and execute commands by typing them directly on the keyboard.
Alongside the CLI is the Graphical User Interface (GUI), which mainly serves as visual aids for the user with icons and coloured text in a user-friendly manner.
This application uses Java as the main programming language and uses JavaFX, HTML and CSS for the GUI.

CLInic primarily serves as a complete, all-in-one solution for small clinics.
It provides clinics with a interactive and efficient system that can handle patient data, medicine stock data, and even has an integrated queue management system for day-to-day clinic operations.

My main responsibility for this project was to implement the UI and storage for the application, amidst some other smaller tasks,
such as the development of the `MedicalRecord` attribute of the `Patient`.
I played the key role of adding the various UI elements to the application window and connecting them with the application logic.

== Summary of contributions

This section serves to summarise my key contributions to this project.

* *Major enhancement 1*: Added the *GUI for the Patient Queue Management System (PQMS)*
** What it does: This GUI window, which resides near the top of the application window, displays to the user the current state of the PQMS.
** Justification: Having a responsive GUI allows users to be able to refer to and read the queue easily, and to perform any commands on the queue quickly, without having to always call a `queue` command to retrieve required queue information.
** Highlights: This feature was implemented with the help of a little HTML for the display and Javascript that allowed the updating of the information in the GUI after each command.
 It required a lot of synchronization between the command results, model objects and the display.
 This was largely handled with some event handling and scripting.
** More details: Please refer to the <<../DeveloperGuide.adoc#application-gui, Developer Guide, Section 4.6>> for a detailed explanation.

* *Major enhancement 2*: Added *storage capabilities* for the `MedicalRecord` model and the `Medicine` model.
** What it does: This allows the user to be able to add and retrieve `MedicalRecord` and `Medicine` objects to the database easily and efficiently.
** Justification: Before this enhancement, any user action that added `MedicalRecord` and `Medicine` to the database will not be saved once the user closes the application.
 We wanted the user to be able to save these information for future use as well.
** Highlights: This feature was implemented with the use of XML, similar to how `Patient` objects were saved to the file in the original _addressbook-level4_ application.
 It required the creation of an `XmlAdapted-` version of each model object as well as careful handling of the adding and retrieval for each model object.
** More details: Please refer to the <<../DeveloperGuide.adoc#Design-Storage, Developer Guide, Section 3.5>> for a detailed explanation.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Added ability for each `Document` to appear in a pop-up window after the respective `Document` commands.
** Added the GUI display for all the `Medicine` objects in the database. This GUI display replaces the left panel displaying the `Patient` objects whenever a `Medicine` related command is called.
** Added `addMedicalRecordCommand` that allows user to add a `MedicalRecord` to a specified `Patient`.

* *Other contributions*:

** Documentation:
*** Improved the navigability and readability of the User Guide by separating Section 3 (Features) into sub-sections.
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Updated the GUI display under `BrowserPanel` to show other information such as `CurrentPatient`, PQMS, and `Patient`.
** Testing:
*** Wrote tests for all UI features to increase coverage from 75% to 79% (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W16-4/main/pull/111[#111])
