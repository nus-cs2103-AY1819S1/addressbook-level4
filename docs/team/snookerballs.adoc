== PROJECT: ExpenseTracker

---

== Overview

This portfolio aims to document the contributions made by *Jaime Chow Wen Juan* to the *ExpenseTracker*.

The *ExpenseTracker* is a desktop expense tracking application developed to aid users in tracking their expenses and
save money. The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface
(GUI) created with JavaFX library. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.


== Summary of contributions

*  *Major enhancement 1*: Budget Panel*

A GUI element that dynamically updates and displays the user's budget and expenses.



*Highlights*

* Budget Panel


** Implemented animation to smooth out changes to the progress percentage.
** Implemented color swapping. The`expenseDisplay` text object now turns red when over budget, and green when under budget.

* Expense and Budget information
** Implemented animation that creates an 'incrementing number' effect when updating the expense information.
** Implemented color swapping. The progress meter now turns red when over budget, and green when under budget.
** Text shrinking. Both text objects dynamically shrinks dependant on the length of the text information displayed.

*Challenges*

* Dynamic Text Size Change - As this is not a standard feature of any text-based JavaFX class, it
                   had to manually implemented. In addition, `TextFlow` objects do not truncate any text overflows, but instead alters the `TextView` width. Attempting to dynamically increase or decrease the size of the text
                   based on the `TextFlow#width` proved difficult and inconsistent when coupled with the animation.

* Testing - There were issues that arose during testing due to the addition of animations. With how animations were implemented, the tests methods would check the values of the `progressBar` and `Text` objects before they were correctly updated.
            Ultimately, a decision to call `Thread#sleep# for the duration of the animation was made.

* *Major enhancement 2*: Notification System*
A feature that allows the sending and displaying of notifications. The system consists of:

** `Notification` - Stores the message to be sent to the user. There are two types of `Notification`: `TipNotification` and `WarningNotification`.
** `NotificationHandler` - Handles the storage and creation of `Notification` objects.
** `NotificationPanel` and `NotificationCard` - GUI Elements that displays the Notifications to the user.
** `XmlAdaptedNotificationHandler`, `JsonTipsStorage` and `XmlAdaptedNotificationHandler` - Manages the saving and reading on Notifications.

*Highlights*

* `Notification`

** Able to randomly generate a new saving tip when the user first logs in for that day.
** Able to send a warning notification when the user is approaching or above budget.

* `NotificationHandler`

*Challenges*

* Testing - Issues with testing mainly arose due to a `LocalDateTime` instance field in the NotificationHandler class. The instance field was initially initialized to `LocalDate#now()`, resulting in many errors due to the dynamic nature of the instance field.
Furthermore, the different methods in which a test `Model` object was instantiated in the existing tests caused numerous errors Thus, many test cases had to be rewritten to pass testing.
[NOTE]
As an example of this issue: a model created via `getTypicalExpenseTracker()` would not call `Model#loadData`, which meant that a `TipNotification` would not be generated.
However, a `Model` created via `getTypicalModel` would not call `Model#loadData`. There were instances where these differently instantiated `Model` objects would be compared.

* Notification Storage - The given `loadDataFromStorage` had difficulty reading a list of Notifications into the `XmlAdaptedNotificationHandler`. Thus, the list had to be separated and manually added to a newly instantiated `ExpenseTracker` object.

* *Minor enhancement*:
. Minor Animations such as GUI fade-in upon login, and animation on statistics GUI elements.
. CSS Overhaul.
. Visual Redesign on the GUI.
