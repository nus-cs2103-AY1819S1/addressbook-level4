== Overview

Inventory manager is for Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) who prefer to use a
desktop app to manage their shop inventory. More importantly, it is optimized for those
who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of
a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It will allow various users to perform multiple inventory
management tasks such as creating sales, generating reports, creating purchase orders
and more. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created
with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
