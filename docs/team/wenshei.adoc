== PROJECT: SuperTA

---

== Overview

SuperTA is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants and Professors of NUS School of Computing to manage their tutorials and students. It is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to delete an existing Assignment in an existing tutorial group.*
** What it does: allows the user to delete the specified assignment from the specified tutorial group.
