== PROJECT: SuperTA

---

== Overview

SuperTA is a desktop application to handle student records for Teaching Assistants and Professors in the School of Computing. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Tutorial Group and Assignment* commands. (Pull Requests https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-2/main/pull/19[#19], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-2/main/pull/62[#62])
** What it does: These are commands to manipulate Tutorial Groups and Assignments, including the creation and viewing of these data structures.
** Justification: This feature is essential in achieving core functionality. It allows teaching assistants to create Tutorial Groups and Assignments, which is key to keeping track of student performance.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects other commands interacting with these data structures.

* *Major enhancement*: improved *User Interface (UI)* (Pull Requests https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-2/main/pull/73[#73], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-2/main/pull/92[#92], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-2/main/pull/135[#135])
** What it does: The user interface was very bare-bones at the start and was not visually appealing. The improvement to the UI makes for a better experience for the user on the whole. The UI was also further improved to display details of tutorial groups, assignments, attendance sessions, as well as students. A few UI event triggers have also been implemented.
