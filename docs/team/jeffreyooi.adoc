== Introduction

Welcome to my project portfolio! I am Ooi Heng Seng, a year 3 Computer Science student in National University of Singapore.

This document showcases the contributions I made to Software Engineering's project MeetingBook.

== Project: MeetingBook

=== Overview

We are a team of 5 students from National University of Singapore's School of Computing. We developed a desktop scheduling
application called MeetingBook for our software engineering's project. The application is created for scheduling meetings
for NUS modules and CCAs. The user interacts with it using a command line interface (CLI), and has a graphical user
interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. We have to deliver the product within 9 weeks. The project is based on a software
engineering project https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level4]. The project is written
in Java, and has about 10kLoC.

=== Summary of contributions

- Major enhancement: updated the user interface

* How it looks like:
+
image::Ui.png[width="600"]
+
* What it does: allows the user to view all information at a glance.
* Justification: the updated user interface improves the user experience significantly because it reduces the amount of
interaction to look for the information.
* Highlights: this enhancement requires additional enhancement to select, find and list commands to interact with all
interface elements. It requires user to enter additional parameter to commands mentioned.
* Credits: JavaFX

- Major enhancement: updated the select command
* Updated select command to select between groups, meetings or persons. Select groups will filter meeting and person
lists to show only relevant information of the group.

- Minor enhancement:
* Updated list command to show all groups, meetings or persons.

- Code contributed: -- To be added --

== Contributions to the User Guide

====
Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting
end-users.
====

=== User Interface
This section will explain the user interface of the application.

image::UiExplanation.png[width="800"]

. Menu bar: provides access to functions
. Group list: displays a list of groups
. Meeting list: displays a list of meetings
. Person list: displays a list of person
. Command box: receives command from user and execute
. Result display: displays the result of command executed
. Update status: displays the update status of current session
. Save path: displays current data save path

=== Selecting a group / person / meeting: `select`

Format: `select [person|group|meeting] [index]` where `[index]` is a positive integer (starts from 1)

****
* If `select [group]` is entered, the person list will be filtered to show only person who belong to the group, and the
meeting list will be filtered to show only meeting scheduled for the group.
* If `select [person]` is entered, only the person that is in the filtered person list will be selected.
* If `select [meeting]` is entered, only the meeting that is in the filtered meeting list will be selected.
****

Examples:

* `select g/1`: selects the first group in the filtered group list.
* `select m/3`: selects the third meeting in the filtered meeting list.
* `select p/2`: selects the second person in the filtered person list.

=== Listing all groups / meetings / persons : `list`

Display all existing groups on the group list / meetings on the meeting list / persons on the person list display.

Format: `list [group|meeting|person]`

[NOTE]
If the list is unfiltered, the list will remain the same.

Examples:

* `list group`: list all groups.
* `list meeting`: list all meetings.
* `list person`: list all persons.

=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `GroupListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Select feature

The select command selects the `GroupCard`, `MeetingCard` or `PersonCard` in the `ObservableList<Group>`, `ObservableList<Meeting>`,
or `ObservableList<Person>` respectively in `Model` that is bounded to the UI. This section will explain current implementation
of select command, execution sequence, and design considerations of multiple implementations.

==== Current Implementation

The select mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`.
It extends `Model` with three lists, `UniquePersonList`, `UniqueMeetingList` and `UniqueGroupList` and implements the following operations:

* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList` -- Updates person list with a specific `Predicate`.
* `Model#updateFilteredGroupList` -- Updates group list with specific `Predicate`.
* `Model#updateFilteredMeetingList` -- Updates meeting list with specific `Predicate`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the select mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `ModelManager` will be initialized with the initial MeetingBook state, and `UniquePersonList`, `UniqueMeetingList` and `UniqueGroupList` contains all person, meetings and groups respectively without filter.

Step 2. The user executes `select` command to select the item type with the specified index in the MeetingBook.
The `SelectCommandParser` parses the command to determine the select type, and the command calls executes the following steps:

* Step 2.1. If the select type is `SELECT_TYPE_GROUP`, a `JumpToGroupListRequestEvent` is sent to update the UI to select the group card,
`Model#updateFilteredPersonList` is called to filter `UniquePersonList` to contain only person that are associated with the group,
and `Model#updateFilteredMeetingList` is called to filter `UniqueMeetingList` to show only meeting that is associated with the group.

* Step 2.2. If the select type is `SELECT_TYPE_MEETING`, a `JumpToMeetingListRequestEvent` is sent to the UI to select the meeting card.

* Step 2.3. If the select type is `SELECT_TYPE_PERSON`, a `JumpToListRequestEvent` is sent to the UI to select the person card.

[NOTE]
If a group is selected, subsequent `select` calls to person and meeting list will only select the person or meeting in the filtered
`UniquePersonList` or `UniqueMeetingList` respectively.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the select command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use prefix to differentiate between selecting group, meeting or person, and use a
single select class to perform all select operations.
** Pros: Easy to implement as there are fewer lines of code required.
** Cons: Harder to extend if need to implement select command for other items, select class will become bloated if too
many items require select command.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command for selecting group, meeting and person.
** Pros: Easy to extend functionality to select other items as all select commands are independent.
** Cons: Requires more code to implement.
* **Alternative 3:** Abstract select class containing required variables and methods without implementation, and select
commands inherit from the abstract class and implement the execution functionality.
** Pros: Good data structure.
** Cons: Requires more code to implement.
