== Project: FoodZoom

---

Hello there! I am Monika Manuela Hengki, a Computer Science student in National University of Singapore. I
like building useful things that can help improve other peopleâ€™s lives. Below you can find some of my
contributions to one of my projects.

== Overview

FoodZoom is a food delivery management desktop application for food businesses to streamline their
delivery process. FoodZoom is responsive and quick as users interact with the application by typing the
commands (using Command Line Interface). FoodZoom allows managers to plan order delivery routes and
dispatch them to deliverymen available. Deliverymen can also quickly view their assigned delivery routes and
increase their efficiency. FoodZoom is built by me and 4 other Computer Science students.

== Summary of Contribution

---
|===
|Given below are contributions that I made to this application.
|===

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to assign orders to a deliveryman.

** What it does: It allows the manager to assign multiple orders to a deliveryman. Subsequently, the
order status changes from `PENDING` to `ONGOING`, which means that it can no longer be edited or
reassigned to another deliveryman.

** Justification: This feature streamlines the food delivery process as the manager can assign orders
to be delivered by their deliverymen conveniently.

** Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it required two-way association between the order and the deliveryman.

* *Minor enhancements*:

** Improved checking for the date of the order to prevent invalid dates.
** Modified command words of some commands to unify the patterns.
