== PROJECT: TheTracker

---

== Overview

TheTracker is an application specifically built for NUS students. Allowing a student to keep track of his/her own occasions, modules and keep up to date with his/her friends.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented *the insertperson feature*
** What it does: Allows the user to build an association between a person and a module, or a person and an occasion.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as the user can now conveniently register his/her associated persons with modules and occasions. This makes TheTracker more of a holistic and useful product.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing delete and edit commands as now an edit to an entity must edit all the entities associated with it as well.
** Credits: _{All abstractions, logic was conceived of solely by me}_

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the new UI panels to display the contents of modules and occasions.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=spikerheado1234&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-12&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Contributed Code]]
