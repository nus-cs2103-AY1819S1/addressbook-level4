== PROJECT: ClinicIO

---

== Overview

This project portfolio serves to document my role and contributions to the ClinicIO project, and to showcase my software
engineering work to potential employers, academic programs, and other interested parties.

ClinicIO was developed by a team of five undergraduate students, as a project for a software engineering module. As a
desktop application, ClinicIO aims to alleviate the administrative workload that doctors and receptionist face in their
clinics every day.

ClinicIO provides users with the ability to manage __patient records__, schedule __appointments__, maintain a __patient
queue__, organize a __medicine inventory__, and analyse __clinic data__.

Due to project constraints, ClinicIO was developed to be operated mainly by the command line, with a visual graphical
interface for its users. Users will need to type commands to access the features of the application, instead of the
usual mouse-clicking.

My team consisted of a team leader, an assistant team leader, and three other developers, each with their own
responsibilities.

As a developer responsible for __code integration__, I was in charge of __versioning__ the code, maintaining the __code
repository__, and __integrating__ various parts of the software to create a working product. Additionally, I was also in
charge of the __Storage__ component of ClinicIO, and designed the __Medicine Inventory__ feature of the application.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section serves to outline the contributions I have made to the development of ClinicIO. This include major and
minor enhancements, code contributed, and other contributions made to my team and project._
|===

==== Major Enhancement 1: added *the ability to add and delete medicines in the clinic's __Medicine Inventory__*

** What it does: allows the user to add and delete medicines in the medicine inventory.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a target user will need an efficient way to
update the list of medicines in the clinic's medicine inventory
** Highlights: This enhancement adds new commands to the existing software.

==== Major Enhancement 2: added *the ability to find and view medicines in the clinic's __Medicine Inventory__*

** What it does: allows the user to find and view medicines in the medicine inventory.
** Justification: A target user will need an efficient way to find and view the details of specific medicines in the
clinic's medicine inventory
** Highlights: This enhancement adds new commands to the existing software.

==== Major Enhancement 3: added *the ability to update medicine quantities in the clinic's __Medicine Inventory__*

** What it does: allows the user to increase and decrease the quantities of medicines in the clinic's medicine inventory.
** Justification: A target user will need an efficient way to update the quantities of medicines when either prescribing
medicines to a patient, or restocking medicines for future prescriptions.
** Highlights: This enhancement adds new commands to the existing software.
