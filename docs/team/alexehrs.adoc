== PROJECT: LearnVocabulary

---

== Overview

LearnVocabulary is a desktop application for people who prefer to use an offline version of the dictionary for learning purposes.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the word of the day feature (command)
** What it does: Looks up the current word of the day on website Dictionary.com. It fetches the word, extracts its meaning and displays it for the user to learn.
** Justification: The features saves time when a user cannot think of a word to learn, or just otherwise would like to learn a new random word that is usually very special or rare.
** Highlights: The feature had to be integrated by looking at several existing commands in detail as well extending code freshly written by another team member (russellong95).
** Some PRs for the feature: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T10-3/main/pull/91[#91], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T10-3/main/pull/93[#93], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T10-3/main/pull/154[#154]

* *Minor enhancement*: Deleted/refactored fields Email, Phone and Address from AB4.
Fields were used extensively throughout the application and required careful but major changes of the existing code to not break the whole application. (Pull requests: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T10-3/main/pull/50[#50] and https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T10-3/main/pull/23[#23])

* *Minor enhancement*: Added different coloring of tags. However, feature was later removed due to a fresh restart of the project. After that I considered the feature to be only "nice to have" and did not reimplement it. PR: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T10-3/main/pull/10[#10]

* *Code contributed*: [RepoSense collated code] (https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=alexehrs)
