* *Major enhancement*:
** Designed and implemented the UI component based on AddressBook(Level 4)
*** What it does: It creates a GUI for the product in which the entry for users to interact with the product consists.
*** Justification: This feature functions importantly since the user-product interaction relies on it.
It also provides users with the first impression and perception of this product.
*** Highlights: JavaFX was used to aid the implementation. The collocation of .java and .fxml file
provides a good structure for the implementation of UI component.

** Implemented `stop`, `seek` and `playlist list` commands
*** What it does: `stop` and `seek` command enables users to stop or seek the playing of tracks. `playlist list` command
lists all playlists in current library.
*** Justification: `stop` and `seek` commands suppelment the playback feature of this product. `playlist list` command
enhances the using of playlist management feature.
*** Highlights: `seek` command takes in special consideration of edge case handling.

* *Other contributions*:
** Minor Enhancement: implemented corresponding test cases to cover newly-implemented codes

*** Tools: configured RepoSense and Codacy.
*** Issue Tracker Management: Issues relevant to individual responsibility were assigned and handled.
