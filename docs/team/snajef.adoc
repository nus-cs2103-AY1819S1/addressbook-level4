== PROJECT: HealthBase

---

== Introduction

This project portfolio page’s purpose is to document my contributions to the project.

HealthBase is a desktop application designed to aid in clinic patient data management. It provides patient data input and management capabilities through a command line interface (CLI) for input and a graphical UI for data display. Its main features include (among others):

* Management of check-in/check-out status of patients
* Real-time management of the check-in/out status of patients
* Patient medication data entry and retrieval
* Patient medical history data entry and retrieval
* Patient dietary restriction(s) data entry and retrieval
* Patient visitor history data entry and retrieval
* Real-time management of the number of visitors any given patient has
* Patient appointment management for doctors

HealthBase was designed and built by me and my team of NUS Year 2 Computer Science students for the CS2103T module. For more information about us, click link:{staticpageslink}AboutUs.html[here].

== Summary of Contributions

This section's purpose is to summarise my contributions to this project. For more details about the contributions, click the link to the corresponding pull request.

* *Major enhancement*: Added `addmeds` command (Pull request(s): link:{prlink}20[#20], link:{prlink}31[#31], link:{prlink}32[#32], link:{prlink}63[#63], link:{prlink}82[#82], link:{prlink}112[#112])
** What it does: this command adds a medication entry to a given patient. The medication entry includes information about the drug name, the dosage, dosage unit, doses per day, and the duration of the prescription in days.
** Justification: this command provides a core functionality of HealthBase (medication data entry and retrieval).
** Highlights: this command affects existing internal representations of the Person class and required significant retooling of tests to fit the new member of the Person class. The implementation was somewhat challenging as it required an extension of the current Person data representation and storage functionality.
* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added `view` command
** Added `sort` command
