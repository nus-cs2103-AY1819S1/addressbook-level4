== Overview

Hospital Management System 2K18 (HMS2K18) is a desktop application designed to aid in the management of a hospital. It provides patient data input and management capabilities through a command line interface for input and a graphical UI for data display. Its main features include (among others):

* Management of check-in/out status of patients
* Real-time management of the check-in/out status of patients
* Patient medication data entry and retrieval
* Patient medical history data entry and retrieval
* Patient dietary restriction(s) data entry and retrieval
* Patient visitor history data entry and retrieval
* Real-time management of the number of visitors any given patient has
* Patient appointment management for doctors


== Summary of contributions

Summary of contributions:

* *Major enhancement*: Added `addmeds` command
** What it does: adds a medication entry to a given patient. The medication entry includes information about the drug name, the dosage, dosage unit, doses per day, and the duration of the prescription in days.
** Justification: this command provides a core functionality of the HMS2K18 (medication data entry and retrieval).
** Highlights: this command affects existing internal representations of the Person class and required significant retooling of tests to fit the new member of the Person class. The implementation was somewhat challenging as it required an extension of the current Person data representation and storage functionality.
* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added `view` command
** Added `sort` command
