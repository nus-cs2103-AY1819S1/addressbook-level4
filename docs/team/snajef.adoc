== PROJECT: HealthBase

== Introduction

This project portfolio pageâ€™s purpose is to document my contributions to the project.

HealthBase is a desktop application designed to aid in clinic patient data management. It provides patient data input and management capabilities through a command line interface (CLI) for input and a graphical UI for data display. Its main features include (among others):

* Management of check-in/check-out status of patients
* Real-time management of the check-in/out status of patients
* Patient medication, medical history, dietary restriction(s), and visitor history data entry and retrieval
* Patient appointment management for doctors

HealthBase was designed and built by me and my team of NUS Year 2 Computer Science students for the CS2103T module. For more information about us, click link:{staticpageslink}AboutUs.html[here].

== Summary of Contributions

This section's purpose is to summarise my contributions to this project. For more details about the contributions, click the link to the corresponding pull request.

* *Major enhancement*: Added `addmeds` command (Pull request(s): link:{prlink}20[#20], link:{prlink}31[#31], link:{prlink}32[#32], link:{prlink}63[#63], link:{prlink}82[#82], link:{prlink}112[#112])
** What it does: this command adds a medication entry to a given patient. The medication entry includes information about the drug name, the dosage, dosage unit, doses per day, and the duration of the prescription in days.
** Justification: this command provides a core functionality of HealthBase (medication data entry and retrieval).
** Highlights: this command affects existing internal representations of the Person class and required significant retooling of tests to fit the new member of the Person class. The implementation was somewhat challenging as it required an extension of the current Person data representation and storage functionality.
* *Major enhancement*: Added `view` command (Pull request(s): link:{prlink}95[#95], link:{prlink}127[#127], link:{prlink}169[#169])
** What it does: this command adds functionality for users to view patient-specific information in the right-side panel of the UI.
** Justification: this command provides a core functionality of HealthBase (viewing patient data), while preventing UI clutter.
** Highlights: this command was designed to be extensible and allows developers to design their own panels for data display without impacting other developers' data displays.
* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added `sort` command
** Added `gendata` command
