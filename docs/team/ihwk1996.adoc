Hello there! I am Ivan, a Year 2 Computer Science student in NUS. This portfolio documents the contributions I have made to several projects. These projects have exposed me to new technologies and helped me to develop relevant skills en route to being a Software Engineer.

== PROJECT: Piconso

== Overview

Piconso is a robust yet simple image-editing tool. Catered towards power users, Piconso users interact through the Command Line Interface (CLI), while providing visual feedback through Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Unlike other heavy image editors, Piconso has a very gentle learning curve as it abstracts out clutter by providing the more essential features (complex editing can still be done with special commands). The features and implementations are well documented in guides for users and developers respectively.
In addition, Piconso is well maintained with high reliability and code quality as it is covered by rigorous tests and checks.

== Role

My role was to facilitate the history of transformations of images within each layer. As the undo and redo feature is done using memoization, images need to be cached after each transformation. I constructed the base class to manage the caching and retrieval of images, then linked it to the Model and Storage components. In addition, I wrote rigorous tests and test utilities to ensure high reliability and simpler maintenance.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous transformations*
** What it does: allows the user to undo previous transformations one at a time. Preceding undone transformations can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes by applying incorrect transformations and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement uses memoization to ensure undo/redo commands are almost instant. Since transformations to images take significant time (especially on large images) and that users typically want to quickly inspect the before and after of their transformation, it is necessary  for undo and redo to be fast. As such, after each transformation, the resulting transformed image is cached into a temporary folder. Undo and redo operations will shift a pointer leftwards or rightwards and read the selected image, instead of reapplying or reversing a transformation process which is time consuming.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo all transformations at once*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous transformations swiftly with a single `undo-all` command. Likewise, all preceding undone transformations can be redone with a single `redo-all` command.
** Justification: This feature provides the user with an extra layer of convenience. At times, the user might feel that he wants to revert back to the original state but has applied many transformations. It would be tedious to apply the undo command one by one, hence having command to undo all transformations would be handy. Similarly, if he feels that undoing all commands is a mistake, he can quickly revert back all transformations with the `redo-all` command.
** Highlights: Similar the the undo/redo feature, undo-all/redo-all commands are also almost instant with the help of memoization.
