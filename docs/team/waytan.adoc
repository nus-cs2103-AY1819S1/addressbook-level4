== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: *Improved `delete` function to properly delete any type of entry*
** Description: Allows the user to delete a person, module or occasion by index. It also removes this entry from all other linked entries.
** Design Decisions: In implementing the feature, I decided to incorporate the following:
*** Inferred Deletion: The deletion will be applied to the currently active list.
*** Deep Deletion: The deletion will automatically all references to this entry (i.e. from other entries' lists)
** Highlights: Inferred deletion required amendments in the model and UI.
This was also useful in implementing the `select` command. +
Deep Deletion required the writing of methods that selectively mutates entries in a list.
The methods were used in the `edit`, `insertperson` and `removeperson` commands.


* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented the `select` feature
** Description: Allows the user to select an entry from the active list, and view their list info.
