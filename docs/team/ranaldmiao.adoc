== PROJECT: Deadline Manager

This portfolio serves to document my contribution in a Software Engineering team project for CS2103T. The team comprises of 5 members and we were tasked to develop a working application within 6 weeks. +

To comply with the module requirements, the team is constrained to start from an existing code base - https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook Level 4] and the user must interact with the application via Command Line Interface (CLI). The final product that my team has developed is **Deadline Manager**, which will be detailed below.

== Overview
Deadline Manager is an application that allows users to easily manage their tasks and deadlines. It enables users to keep track of and focus on important activities.

For more information, the Github page with the full source can be found: [https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w17-4.github.io/main[on GitHub]].

== Summary of Contributions
* *Major enhancement*: added the *ability to manage attachments of tasks in Deadline Manager*
** What it does: It allows users to add, list, delete or retrieve (get) attachments from any task added to the Deadline Manager. Users that want to associate certain files to a particular task can do so via this Attachment feature.
** Justification: Tasks usually come with associated files that are required when a user performs the task. With this feature, users will be able to categorize and organize files related to tasks. This will reduce the time required for the user to search for these files at a subsequent stage, thereby increasing effectiveness in completing tasks.
//For instance, assignments for students usually come with an assignment brief. This feature allows them to associate that assignment brief with the task of completing the assignment. When the student decides to attempt the assignment, the assignment brief can be easily retrieved from Deadline Manager, thereby saving the hassle of searching for the file.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires interaction with the user's filesystem. As users can run Deadline Manager with different Operating Systems, the filesystem in each Operating System behaves slightly differently. As a result, intensive testing and careful coding was required in order to ensure that the feature works on various Operating Systems.

* *Minor enhancement*: modified the *User Interface* (UI) to be task-centric
 ** What was modified:
 *** Removed UI elements from the original AddressBook that were not relevant to Deadline Manager.
 *** Added UI elements that displayed attributes of Tasks that are relevant to Deadline Manager. Example: displaying priority, deadline and the labels of attachments of a task.
