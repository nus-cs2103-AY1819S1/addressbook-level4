== PROJECT: InsuRen

---

== Overview

'Ren' in Mandarin translates to 'person' or 'people', and true to our name, this app is all about managing oneâ€™s network of clients in an organized, efficient and intuitive manner. InsuRen is geared to the needs of the modern Insurance salesman, but anyone whose business is their strong rapport with their clients will find this to be an indispensable tool.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *edit client contact information and delete client contacts by name*.
** What it does: Instead of having to edit or delete contact info by using an index, you can edit and delete contacts directly using their name, provided their name is distinguishable from all other names present in InsuRen.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because normally, editing requires scrolling or using `find` to filter the list first. Since we don't want the user to have to use the mouse, and we want to speed up processes, editing by name will help achieve the product's goals.
** Highlights: This enhancement extends the `edit` and `delete` commands and makes use of a new `Predicate` and `PersonFinderUtil` to find a `Person` when provided a unique identifier.
** Credits: Nil.

* *Minor enhancement*: Make the address, email and phone number fields `Optional` (Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-1/main/pull/16[#16], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-1/main/pull/33[#33]).
** What it does: Instead of requiring all fields to be filled when adding a person, which may require an Insurance Agent to fill placeholder information, she can leave several fields blank instead.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly, because insurance agents do not always have all the information about their clients they need, but they may still need to keep track of them and contact them with whatever incomplete information they have. This feature thus adds a degree of freedom and ease of use to insurance agents.
