== PROJECT: CAPTracker

---

== Overview

CapTracker is a desktop application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Transcript file storage feature.
** What it does: Automatically saves and updates all of user's transcript data into a file, and loads this file.
** Justification: Users should be able to access previously created modules when opening the app again, otherwise they would have to re-enter all their modules again. They can also load their data in another computer or share it with other users if desired, simply by sharing the file itself.
** Highlights:
*** By using the `Jackson` library to store the Transcript data as a JSON file instead of an XML file, we avoid having to write `XMLSerializableTranscript` and `XMLAdaptedModule` classes.
* *Minor enhancement*: Display and updating of current CAP and CAP Goal.
** What it does: Displays current CAP, immediately updates whenever completed modules are edited. Displays CAP Goal if set, else displays NIL; immediately updates whenever incomplete modules are changed or adjusted.
** Justification: Users should be able to view their current CAP and CAP Goal as they are updated, without having to request for them through a command.
