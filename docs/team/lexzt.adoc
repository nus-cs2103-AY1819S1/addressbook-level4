== Introduction

---

Hi! My name is Fong Zhi Zhong but you can call me Keith! I am currently a second year student at National University of Singapore studying Computer Science.  +
As a passionate programmer, I believe I can solve many problems through coding.

I am the team leader for _Car Park Finder_, a project for my CS2103T Software Engineering module,
where I was in charge of UI (user interface), threading, scheduling and tracking.

== Project: Car Park Finder
:sectnums:

---
== Overview

_Car park Finder_ is a CLI (command line interface) application to find HDB (Housing Development Board) car parks in Singapore.
It allows you to display a list of car parks with the convenience of typing. It provides crucial information like real time updates and cost of car parks.
If you use the computer frequently and commute by driving, you would find our application useful in your daily lives. +
Interested? Head towards our releases page to download and try it out! No installation is required.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the development of the application. They showcase my technical depth and ability._
|===

* *Major enhancement 1*: Modified the *find feature to search for partial words* and *ignore certain words*.
** What it does: Allows the user to search for partial instances of words without needed to type everything.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can type lesser and the app should provide the same data still.
** Highlights:  This enhancement affects the existing commands and commands to be added in the future. I also wrote extra code which allowed us to re-use in the future.

* *Major enhancement 2*: Integrated *Google maps* javascript api.
** What it does: Every time the user sends a command, the display will be updated accordingly. E.g. Selecting a car park shows that one and only carpark.
** Justification: This feature greatly improves the look and feel of the application. Plus it allows further more information to be displayed.
** Highlights:  This enhancement allows the user to see where the car park is in the entire map without needing to interact with the GUI itself.


* *Minor enhancements*:
** Pulled postal code information using coordinates data by querying an API to convert it to store in a file for quick loading.
** Credits: [https://github.com/cgcai/SVY21[SVY21 to WGS84]].
