== PROJECT: JxMusic

---

== Overview

JxMusic is a desktop music player application developed as a school project for the learning of Software
Engineering principles. The project is built upon https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/[AddressBook(Level 4)].
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=hidingmode[*Code contributed*]

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented Player component
** What it does: Handles all audio related functionalities by interfacing with JavaFX Media.
** Justification: This is the core feature of JxMusic as it handles audio related interactions in a music player application.
** Highlights: This enhancement supports new media control commands. Existing mp3 player libraries for Java were briefly evaluated. Before settling on JavaFX Media, I created a https://gist.github.com/hidingmode/7b138634854569400fed9fbd6ec4e0b0[prototype player] to experiment on its API. However, the implementation of Player experienced some setbacks due to unforeseen issues with JavaFX Media.
*** Discovery of https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8210828[confirmed JavaFX Media bug]
*** Resolution of https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-3/main/issues/35[another suspected JavaFX Media bug]
*** Incompatibility of https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-3/main/pull/101/commits/a4c5170c53c234f023e48b3e0ade3654457fd225#diff-197aef6c54da4c4e85898e9156e245b4R37[JavaFX Media and JUnit, and by extension, Travis and AppVeyor].
*** Asynchronous nature of JavaFX Media

* *Major enhancement*: Coordinated refactoring process of entire code base
** What it does: Transforms most of the original address book 4 codes to fit as a music player.
** Justification: As the original code base was an address book application, a major overhaul was made to transform it into a music player application.
** Highlights: Written elaborative and detailed issues and PRs.
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-3/main/issues/34[Guiding principle] was to transform `AddressBook` to `Library`, `Person` to `Playlist`, `Tag` to `Track`. https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-3/main/pull/42[Source refactored] in 2 days and https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-3/main/pull/49[tests refactored] in 3 days.

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented `play`, `playlist new`, `duration` commands.
** What it does:
*** https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-3/main/pull/63[`play`]: Plays a playlist/track or resume from a pause
*** https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-3/main/commit/ff264c5af1fe731f7bc4c9b641bcd650db6be9fa#diff-23a2194e30915cb772a3d1546d69fc5d[`playlist new`]: Creates a new playlist
*** https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-3/main/commit/bd0e7ebed3283be366708556debad5b3bd9a5708#diff-76e971f55875fb7bcd7f30543550f829[`duration`]: Shows the duration of a playing track
** Justification: These are just some of the many commands the team worked on as a whole.
** Highlights:
`play` command caters for 5 modes of usage - `play p/`, `play p/<playlist>`, `play t/`, `play t/<track>`, and `play`
