== PROJECT: OASIS

---

== Overview

OASIS is an employee management application that is suitable for small-to-medium sized enterprises. It is an all-in-one tool for office administration and communication that runs on any computer. With the use of primarily textual commands coupled with a beautiful user interface, you can get your administrative jobs done faster compared traditional point-and-click applications. Some of the main features that you can look forward to using are employee records management, authentication and permissions, assignment management, and leave management.

== Summary of contributions

The following section highlights my major and minor contributions to OASIS:

*Code Contributed:* [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=rnardha&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-11&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Reposense]]

* *Major enhancement: Assignment Management*
** *Adding new assignment:* `addasignment`
*** What it does: This command allows authorized users to create new assignment.
*** Justification: This function allows authorized user to computirized assignment documents, which would assist in easy retrieval as well as reduces paper waste.

** *Delete assignment:* `deleteassignment`
*** What it does: This command allows authorized users to delete assignment from the system when it is no longer needed.
*** Justification: Having an overwhealming number of data might not necessarily be good.
Especially, when the data is no longer important. Therefore, when the assignment data is
not used anymore, it can be remove from the system.

** *Edit assignment:* `editassignment`
*** What it does: This allows authorized users to make changes to existing
assignment documents.
*** Justification: Making changes in order to document improvement will be needed during the course of the assignment.

** *List assignments:* `listassignments`
*** What it does: This allows the user to view all the existing assignments in
the system.
*** Justification: This will enable the users to search for infomation of the assignment
they are working on.

** *Highlights:* Being the first time working in a medium-sized project and making improvements to the existing implementation, I picked up
many technical and writing skills. Prior understanding of the model and interaction of the components is also needed, However, the most
important lesson I learnt is the importance of writing clear documentation. It is because with clear documentation, collaborating with others
is easier.

* *Minor enhancement:*
** Keyboard Shortcuts
*** What it does: With valid key combinations, command word corresponding to the
key pressed will be written into the command box.
*** Justification: Frequent users could access commonly used commands quickly.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (4 releases) on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Update `AddCommand` to accept new person with assignment, if and only if
the assignments exist withing the system.(Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-1/main/pull/184[#184])
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features implemented by me.(Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-1/main/pull/116[#116])
** Community:
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class
