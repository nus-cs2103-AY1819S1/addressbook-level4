== PROJECT: Heart²

This portfolio aims to document my contributions to the project *_Heart²_*.

GitHub: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main

== Overview

*_Heart²_* is a desktop wedding application for wedding planners to efficiently manage their clients and vendors.
*_Heart²_* allows wedding planners to quickly find suitable clients and vendors by automatically matching them together based on the vendors' services and the client's requirements.
The user primarily interacts with *_Heart²_* through a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
*_Heart²_* is written in Java, with about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

=== *Major enhancement 1*:

Enabled support for two different types of contacts, clients and vendors, in *_Heart²_*.

** *What it does*:

Allows the user to be work with two different types of contacts using *_Heart²_*.

** *Justification*:

*_Heart²_* is made for wedding planners to efficiently manage their clients and vendors, two of their key stakeholders.
Therefore, we chose to model the contacts in *_Heart²_* after clients and vendors.

** *Highlights*:

. This enhancement serves a foundation of many features in *_Heart²_*, including:
`add`, `delete`, `update`, `view`, `list`, `addservice` and `automatch`.

. In *_Heart²_*, the users are presented with two separated lists.
However, in *_Heart²_*, there is only one contact list for both clients and vendors.
Filters are constantly applied to this contact list as commands are entered so as to maintain the illusion of a distinct list to the user.

. This enhancement required extensive refactoring of the codebase as the inherited, legacy code only supported a single contact.
*_Heart²_* currently supports two types of contacts, and can easily be extended to support even more types of contacts with this enhancement.

=== *Major enhancement 2*:

Implemented unique IDs for contacts.

** *What it does*:

Allows the user to refer to contacts by their unique IDs.

** *Justification*:

The inherited implementation from AddressBook (Level 4) had users use the contact's relative position in the currently shown list to refer to that contact.
For our users to make use of their time most efficiently, we chose to have our users be able to refer to contacts using IDs, as opposed to the previous implementation.

In the previous, inherited implementation from AddressBook (Level 4), the user must ensure that the current list shown in the UI contains the contact *and* check the contact's relative position on the list.
With unique IDs for contacts, the context of the commands do not change, and this allows our users to know quickly the context of their commands and thus execute any command at any point of time in *_Heart²_*.

With this unique ID system, our users are able to simplify and improve their workflow on *_Heart²_*,

** *Highlights*:

. This enhancement serves as another foundation of many features in *_Heart²_*, including:
`delete`, `update`, `view`, `addservice` and `automatch`.

. Together with the contact type, it allows *_Heart²_* to be able to offer a very simple and intuitive command syntax.
+
Commands pertaining to a contact type start with the contact type (`client` or `vendor`).
More specific commands pertaining to a specific contact have the unique ID appended to the contact type.

=== *Minor enhancement 1*:

Updated the main parser that parses all commands entered by the user.

** *What it does*:

Implements the command syntax enabled by the two previously mentioned enhancements.

** *Highlights*:

. This enhancement although minor proved to be quite a challenge, because commands differ in their components.
+
For example, `help` consists of just a word, `client list` consists of two words, `vendor#3 delete` consists of 2 words and the unique ID, and lastly `client#1 update n/Wai Lun` consists of 2 words, the unique ID and the parameters for the command.
+
It required some research on regular expressions in Java and tinkering in JShell.
In the end, only a single parser is used to parse and identify all of *_Heart²_* commands when they are entered by the user.


=== *Minor enhancement 2*:

Extended the `add`, `delete`, `update` and `view` commands in *_Heart²_*.

** *What it does*:

Gives functionality to the mentioned commands.

** *Highlights*:

. This enhancement makes use of and relies on all three enhancements mentioned above.

. The text feedback to the user is customised based on the command entered by the user.
Due to having two possibilities (`client` and `vendor`) for these commands, and in order avoid "hard-coding" every possible text feedback to the user, these text feedback use Java's string formatting feature.
+
With this, the text feedback can be easily extended for even more contact types if we choose to add more contact types in the future.

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide._
|===

=== Working with a specific contact

Contacts in *_Heart²_* are assigned a unique ID each for you to refer to the contact at any point of time when using *_Heart²_*.


[TIP]
Commands pertaining to one specific contact have an additional unique ID appended to the back of `client` or `vendor`.

[TIP]
These IDs are persistent for one session. Each restart of Heart reassigns IDs to contacts, effectively accounting for deleted contacts and compacting the IDs of your contacts.

[NOTE]
IDs can be similar for `client` and `vendor`. However, since the contact type and ID come hand in hand, the contacts are still effectively unique!

==== Viewing a contact: `view`

You can `view` detailed information about a specific contact using its unique ID.
This information will be displayed on the right panel in *_Heart²_*.

[TIP]
`view` shows you all the information regarding the specific client, which includes the name, phone number, email address, tags, residential (client) or office (vendor) address and services requested (client) or offered (vendor).

[NOTE]
*Any* command following `view` will hide the information shown before on the panel on the right.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE>#<ID> view`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client#3 view`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor#3 view`
|=====

[TIP]
Clicking on the contact panels on the left of *_Heart²_*'s GUI corresponds to a `view` command for that contact!

==== Deleting a contact: `delete`

You can also `delete` a contact from *_Heart²_*, by specifying its unique ID.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE>#<ID> delete`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client#123 delete`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor#123 delete`
|=====

[TIP]
You can `undo` and `redo` deleting a contact!

==== Updating a contact: `update`

You can also `update` a contact's particulars, again by specifying its unique ID, followed by the updated fields.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE>#<ID> update [n/FULL_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS] [a/HOME_ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

[NOTE]
You cannot update a contact to another contact that already exists in the application. Two contacts are considered duplicates if they are the same type (either both clients or both vendors), possess the same name, and either the same phone number or the same email address.

[NOTE]
When editing tags, adding of tags is not cumulative and existing tags of the contact will be removed.

[TIP]
You can remove all tags for a contact by updating the contact with `t/` (without specifying any tags after it)!

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client#123 update n/Jane Doe e/janedoe@gmail.com`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor#123 update n/Bob Vans e/bobvans@gmail.com`
|=====

[TIP]
You can `undo` and `redo` updating a contact!

=== Unique ID feature
*_Heart²_* assigns a unique ID to every `client` and `vendor` when they are added into *_Heart²_*.
This ID is unique within their contact type, meaning that a `client` and a `vendor` may have the same ID, but since this ID comes hand in hand with the contact type, they are effectively unique.
These IDs are last for a single session, and *_Heart²_* reassigns the IDs at the start of the next session.

==== Current Implementation
Both the `Client` and `Vendor` class have a `public static` running counter starting from 1.
When a `client` or `vendor` is created, it is assigned that number, before incrementing it by 1.
The `contact` then has this ID for this session, and the user can use this ID, coupled with the contact type to always refer to this particular contact.

This unique ID is used by many other commands, namely: `add`, `delete`, `update`, `view`, `addservice`, `automatch`.
It allows for these commands to be executed at any point in *_Heart²_*, with always the same context.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How should we refer to contacts in *_Heart²_*?

* *Alternative 1*:
Use the legacy implementation, which is to use the relative position of the contact in the list.

** Pros: No change is required, as it is the legacy implementation.

** Cons: Users have to navigate to a list that shows that contact, and the relative position of that contact may keep changing throughout a session.

* *Alternative 2* (current choice):

** Pros: Users are able to refer back to a particular contact at any time, without requiring the current list shown to contain that contact.
Also, this ID will never change during a session, so the user can confidently use the ID knowing that it will always refer to that contact.

** Cons: Users still have to remember this unique ID to refer back to the contact. It might be hard to remember the ID.

After much consideration, we decided to go with option 2.
*_Heart²_* is built for speed, and we would like to give our users flexibility to execute any command within *_Heart²_* at any time.
We believe that this can give users more control and power over their work using *_Heart²_*, and therefore we chose to implement this unique ID system.

However, we also do realise that users might find it hard to remember the unique ID assigned to the contact.
While users can quickly look at a recent contact using the command `history`, a possibly quality-of-life improvement would be to implement a mnemonic unique identifier.

=== Add contact feature
*_Heart²_* requires users to explicitly specify whether the contact to be added is a `client` or a `vendor` in the command.

* `client add n/Wai Lun p/90463327 e/wailun@u.nus.edu a/PGP House`
* `vendor add n/Lun Wai p/72336409 e/lunwai@u.nus.edu a/RVRC`

The above commands add a `client` and a `vendor`, together with the details provided, respectively.

This differentiation between `client` and `vendor` facilitates many other features of *_Heart²_*.
It complements the unique ID feature earlier to ensure that a `client` and a `vendor` with the same ID are still differentiable due to the contact type.

Adding of duplicate contacts are not allowed in *_Heart²_*.
[NOTE]
A contact is considered a duplicate if they are of the same contact type *and* have the same name *and* have *either* the same phone number *or* email address.

==== Current Implementation
Both `Client` and `Vendor` classes inherit from an abstract `Contact` class.
When adding a contact, either a new `Client` or a `Vendor` object is instantiated.
Both `Client` and `Vendor` objects are added to a list of generic type `Contact`.

In order to differentiate them, there is an abstract method `Contact#getType()` that `Client` and `Vendor` implement differently.
`Client` objects return a `ContactType.CLIENT` enum while `Vendor` objects return a `ContactType.VENDOR` enum.

When adding a contact, the parser first distinguishes whether it is an addition of a `client` or `vendor`.
The correct `ContactType` enum is then passed to `AddCommandParser`.
The `AddCommandParser` parses the argument to create the appropriate contact, and creates the appropriate `AddCommand`.

This `AddCommand` is passed back to the `LogicManager`, and the method `execute()` is called.
The contact is then added to the model.

Below is the sequence diagram of a `client add` command.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How should we store `Client` and `Vendor` objects in *_Heart²_*?

* *Alternative 1* (current choice):
`Client` and `Vendor` objects are stored in a more general `Contact` list.
** Pros: Easy to implement by tweak the inherited legacy list slightly.

** Cons: Cannot tell immediately if an element in the `Contact` list is a `Client` or `Vendor`.
This might take a longer time to display lists, due to having to filter them every time.

* *Alternative 2*:
Hold `Client` and `Vendor` objects differently in two different lists.
** Pros: Able to get `Client` or `Vendor` immediately without having to go through the entire `Contact` list as in alternative 1.
** Cons: Difficult and extremely tedious to implement.

===== Aspect: How restrictive should the definition of a duplicate contact be?

* *Alternative 1*:
It should be regardless of contact type, meaning a `client` and a `vendor` cannot have the same name *and* either the same phone number *or* email.

** Pros: No additional implementation required. The legacy implementation already supports this.

** Cons: Less flexibility for our users. A `client` cannot be a `vendor` possibly.

* *Alternative 2* (current choice):
A `client` and a `vendor` can have similar fields, meaining a `client` and a `vendor` can possibly have the same name, phone number *and/or* email.

** Pros: More flexibility for our users. A `client` can be a `vendor` too, which is possible in the real world.

** Cons: Additional implementation to have.
