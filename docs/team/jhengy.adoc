== Overview
This document showcases my contributions to this team project which consists of five team members. It is done in a semester long (13 weeks) NUS module CS2103T. Thanks to the help from my other four team members. Please refer to https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-1/main/blob/master/docs/AboutUs.adoc[AboutUs] page for more details of the team.

ResuMaker is a fast, flexible and customizable resume generator aimed at computer science professionals. On top of the Command Line Interface where most of the user interaction takes place, it also provides users with an intuitive and user friendly Graphic User Interface. +


== Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Responsive Display of Expanded Entry
** What it does: It allows for the responsive display of the bullet description of an entry whenever a user edits the description of that particular entry.
** Justification: This is a useful feature as it provides a timely feedback to the user about the latest description of an entry that has been modified. Without this responsive feature, the user may mistakenly feed in the wrong description to an entry without knowing it or he would have to manually select the edited entry to disclose its description.
** Highlights: This feature involves implementation of multiple components, i.e. UI, Logic, Model and Commons
** Credits: Let me acknowledge the se-edu/addressbook-level4 team for their overall architecture design that lays the foundation for the implementation of this enhancement and also for their idea on event driven design which is central to making the expanded entry display responsive.
