== PROJECT: Anakin

---

== Overview

This project portfolio page serves to document my contributions to the Anakin project.

Anakin is a desktop flashcard management application created by team T09-2 to solve the inherent problems associated
with physical flashcards. It aims to facilitate quick and intuitive management of virtual flashcards as well as the sharing of flashcard decks. Additionally, it features the ability to rate the difficulty of individual flashcards and a scheduling algorithm that prompts reviews of cards based on their difficulty rating.

Team T09-2 consisted of myself, Joel Lee, Tay Yu Jia, David Goh, and Truong Thanh.

The user interacts with Anakin using a command-line interface, and has a GUI created with JavaFX. Anakin is written
in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Anakin's codebase draws from https://se-edu.github.io/[SE-EDU]'s AddressBook Level 4.

== Summary of contributions

=== Preface

This section summarizes my contributions to the project in terms of code I have written, as well as other general
areas which had a positive impact on the function of the product (e.g. code reviews, bug fixes).

* *Code contributed:* https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=tomforge[GitHub]

* *Area of Responsibility:* Storage
** I was in charge of the Storage component in this project, and handled the initial adaptation of AddressBook's
storage component for use with Anakin. I served as the subject matter expert for any queries my team had for this
area.
** The Storage component allows you to save the data you have in Anakin on a seperate file, and also
supports the loading of external data from a file into Anakin. Essentially, it acts as the bridge between disk (file)
storage and program memory, containing functions to convert Anakin state to and from XML files.
** This allowed Anakin to be portable and persistent. You will no longer have to worry about losing your precious
 data after closing the Anakin program.

* *Major enhancement:*

** *Added the ability to track user performance*
*** I implemented the `classify` feature which allows you to classify your cards into various difficulties. In the
background, I also tracked the number of times you have classified each card. This feature allows you to note which
cards you struggled the most with, or found relatively easy. Besides documentation purposes, this feature also paves
the way for card scheduling based on your performance. This is implemented in Anakin's `schedule` feature,  where cards
that the user is struggling with will show up more often for review. This personalization is what truly
differentiates Anakin as a smart flashcard manager.

* *Minor enhancement:*

** *Implement card creation and deletion*: I implemented the ability to create a new card in a deck with the given
question and answer, as well as the ability to delete cards from decks.

* *Other contributions*:

** I drafted the initial architecture of the Model interface
** I wrote tests for the Storage component as well as other utility functions

** Community:

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting
end-users._
|===


=== Card difficulty classification : `classify`
Allocates a difficulty (easy, normal, hard) to the card currently being reviewed. +
This indicates how you felt about the difficulty of the card, relative to your performance. This rating will be taken
into consideration when scheduling cards for review. For example, a card rated `easy` will show up less often compared
to a card rated `hard`. +
Format: `classify DIFFICULTY`

****
* The *DIFFICULTY* parameter should be one of the strings: {`easy`, `normal`, `hard`}
* The *DIFFICULTY* parameter is case-insensitive
* By default, cards are assigned a `normal` difficulty
****

==== Example

1.  You decide to review a deck.
+

2. You encounter a difficult question. You would like to document this for future revision. Simply type in
`classify`, followed by the desired difficulty (in this case, `hard`).
+

3. Upon ending the review, you should be able to see the updated difficulty classification on your cards.

=== Storage component

This section details the Storage component, which is the bridge between internal application state and external files.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can store `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back
* can save Anakin's data in XML format and read it back

=== Performance Tracking Implementation

This section details the implementation details and considerations of the performance tracking feature.

==== Current Implementation

Cards contain the `Performance` parameter, implemented as an `enum`, as well as a `timesReviewed` counter. The fields
 are set to `normal` difficulty and `0` counts respectively on initialization. Since these are metadata fields, they
 will be considered optional and a `Card` can still be created without specifying them, which will result in the
 fields being reset to the default initializations.

The user can change the difficulty of a card during "review" mode. Users can only do this on the card they are
currently reviewing, as it is the only time it makes sense to do so. Cards assigned a difficulty will have their
`timesReviewed` counter incremented by one.

The command available to the user will be `classify DIFFICULTY`, where `DIFFICULTY` is any of the strings
 `easy`, `normal`, `hard`, corresponding to the level of perceived difficulty for that
 flashcard.

Given below is an example usage scenario for the performance tracking feature.

Step 1. The user requests to "review" a deck. He sees the question of card A from the deck.

Step 2. The user requests to see the answer. He sees the displayed answer.

Step 3. The user executes `classify hard`. Card A is now assigned the difficulty of `hard`.

Step 4. The user continues reviewing the rest of the cards in the deck.

Step 5. Card A is shown to the user more regularly when he reviews the same deck in the future.
