== PROJECT: MeNUS

---
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-4/main[*MeNUS*]

== Overview

*MeNUS* is an all-in-one restaurant management desktop app designed to help restaurant owners
and managers streamline the process of managing restaurants within National University of Singapore (NUS).
With this app, users can manage their menus, sales, and even reservations!

This portfolio showcases my contributions to this project.

== Summary of Contributions
* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=m4dkip[RepoSense]
* *Major enhancement*: Added the *Reservation Management* feature
** *What it does*: Allows the user to manage a Reservations List using various commands
** *Justification*: It can be messy to manually manage restaurant reservations using pen and paper.
This feature enables a systematic and reliable way to manage reservations.
** *Highlights*: This project required me to communicate with my teammates to integrate our different
management systems together. It required an in-depth analysis of the underlying *MeNUS* architecture.
** *Credits*: Dates are parsed using https://github.com/joestelmach/natty[Natty], a natural language date parser.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a way to add a command alias(a shortcut) to each command to allow users to type commands faster:
