== PROJECT: CLInic

== 1. Introduction
Hello, I am Yu Cong. I am currently studying Computer Science as my major in School of Computing, National University of Singapore.
I formed a team with 4 other students to create CLInic for the CS2103T module (Introduction to Software Engineering)
as part of my university education.

// write clearly this is to showcase contributions
This project portfolio serves to document my contributions to this project. You can see my contributions to
the <<Summary of Contributions, project>>, <<Contributions to the User Guide, user guide>> and <<Contributions to the Developer Guide, developer guide>> below.

CLInic is a desktop application designed for clinics who wish to automate their daily operations.
CLI in CLInic is an acronym for Command Line Interface, which is the primary method to use the application.
Unlike traditional address books, the doctor or clinic receptionist can easily `add`, `edit` or `find` the information of
patient or medicine by entering just one simple line in the command box.

// list of main features
This is what CLInic has to offer:

. Efficient management of patient and medicine information.
. Logical system to control the patient queue.
. Customised receipts, medical certificates and referral letters for clinics.

== 2. Summary of Contributions
//preface to this section to inform reader purpose of this section
In this section, you can find the major and minor enhancement that I made for CLInic,
as well as my contributions to the project.

* *Major enhancement*: Implementation of *medicine records system* in CLInic.
** What it does: It allows the clinic receptionist to automate the tracking of the amount of medicines.
** Justification: The amount of medicines is tracked in the application instead of paper and pen. This reduces the human error
made by messy administrative work or negligence.
There are also useful commands that can organise or find the information of a medicine.
With this, you do not have to manually note down the change in level of medicine every time a medicine is dispensed.
** Highlights: With the `checkstock` command, you can easily list out all medical stocks that are low in stock in just 2 seconds!

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Rephrased output messages to make it more comprehensible.

* *Code contributed*:
** Click https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=99percentile[here] to see what I wrote!

* *Other contributions*:
** Wrote the test utilities for other team members to build their tests upon.
** Advised my team to apply knowledge learned in lecture where necessary.
** Reviewed pull requests : https://github.com[#27], https://github.com[#31], https://github.com[#107]
** Configured <<config.json, config.json>> to allow Reposense to detect each member's works.
** Redrew the _Structure of the Model Component_ in the Developer Guide to model CLInic better.
