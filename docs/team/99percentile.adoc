== PROJECT: CLInic

---

== Overview

CLInic is a desktop application made for clinics. The CLI in CLInic stands for Command Line Interface, which is the main method to use this application.
CLInic also has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to display information in a structured and user-friendly manner. This application uses Java as the
programming language and uses JavaFX, HTML and CSS for the GUI.

My task in CLInic is to implement *the classes and commands concerning medicines*.

The project scope for CLInic is to morph the given addressbook-level4 into a clinic management application that allows users to manage patient
information and medicine information and additionally manage the clinic queue.


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implementation of *medical records in CLInic*
** What it does: This system allows the clinic to keep track of medical stocks in the clinic.
** Justification: This system improves the product significantly because it has created another use case for this application apart from just storing patient and medicine information.
** Highlights: This system builds upon existing commands, patient information and medicine information. This system attempts to model the real life queue system in the clinic and the commands
are made to be as intuitive as possible.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Integration of `ReceiptCommand` and PQMS.
** Enhancement of GUI.
