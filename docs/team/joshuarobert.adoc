== PROJECT: OASIS
 ---
== Overview
Office Assistance Specialized Integration System (OASIS) is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing employees, while allowing employees to handle some automatic features themselves.
 This project portfolio summarizes the contributions that I have to the project.

== Summary of contributions
The following section shows my major code contributions to OASIS.

=== Major enhancement: Added *the ability to delete employees and add them to the archive list*
==== Behaviour:
Allows a user with `Department Manager` permissions to delete an employee and it will be automatically added to the `archivelist` which can be viewed at a later time.

User can then view the `archivelist` by clicking on "ArchiveList" button on the List Picker Panel as shown below:

==== Justification:
We want the Users to have the option of deleting an employee from the system but keeping his/her information incase of future need for it.

Having the `archivelist` achieves that for us, an employee will remain in the system even after being deleted from the `archivelist`.

Our users will also be able to permanently delete employee information if they choose to by deleting them from the `archivelist`.

Lastly, if there is a need to restore the employee back to the `activelist` a user with the right permissions can restore the employee from the `archivelist` to the `activelist`.
