Welcome to Derek-Hardy's Portfolio! I am Zhuang Xinjie, a computer science undergraduate at NUS.

Here you can find details on my contributions to the Software Engineering project.

== PROJECT: MeetingBook

MeetingBook is a desktop scheduler application targeted at university students involved in
multiple Co-Curricular Activities and Project-Based modules. The application is a modified contact book
with features to group contacts and assign meetings to such groups. MeetingBook is written by a team of 5 students
from National University of Singapore's School of Computing. It is forked from
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level4]
written by https://se-edu.github.io/[SE-EDU].

=== Summary of contributions

* **Major enhancement 1**
: added the `Group` class

** What it does: allow categorisation of persons according to their project group, discussion group and CCA etc.
** Justification: This feature allows user to categorise his/her contacts based on their group associations.
** Highlights: This feature is in parallel with person. While it does not affect existing functions, interactions
between the two in the future can be complex.

* **Major enhancement 2**
: added the ability to add and delete a `Group` into and from the MeetingBook.
*** What it does: allow creation and deletion of customised `Group` in the MeetingBook.
*** Justification: This feature allows user to modify the existing categories of people.
*** Highlights: This feature makes use of `UniqueGroupList` in the AddressBook to manipulate the list of groups.

* **Major enhancement 3**
: added the ability to join and remove an existing contact person into an existing group in the MeetingBook.
*** What it does: allow to establish membership relation between persons and groups in MeetingBook.
*** Justification: This feature allows user to modify how existing persons are categorised.
*** Highlights: This feature makes use of `UniqueGroupList` in person, and `UniquePersonList` in group to keep track of membership relation among them.

|_Shown below are my contributions to the User Guide. They demonstrates my ability to write documentation and manuals targeting end-users._
|===

==== Adding a new group: `addGroup`

Add a new group with user input title into MeetingBook. +

Format: `addGroup n/[Name]` +

Examples:

* `addGroup n/CS2103T` +
Adds a new group with title 'CS2103T' into the MeetingBook.
* `addGroup n/Discussion Group 1` +
Adds a new group with title 'Discussion Group 1' into the MeetingBook.

==== Deleting a group: `deleteGroup`

Remove the group that matches use input title. +

Format: `deleteGroup n/[Name]` +

Examples:

* `deleteGroup n/CS2103T` +
Removes the group with title 'CS2103T', which is added previously, from MeetingBook.
* `deleteGroup n/Discussion Group 1` +
Removes the group with title 'Discussion Group 1', which is added previously, from MeetingBook.

==== Joining a person to group: `join`

Add a person, specified by name, into a group, specified by the group title. +

Format: `join n/[Name] g/[Group]` +

Example:

* `join n/Derek g/CS2103T` +
Makes the person 'Derek' to be a member of group 'CS2103T'.

[NOTE]
Both the person and group should exist in the MeetingBook.

==== Removing a person from group: `leave`

Remove a person, specified by name, from a group, specified by the group title. +

Format: `leave n/[Name] g/[Group]` +

Example:

* `leave n/Derek g/CS2101` +
Removes the person 'Derek' from the group 'CS2101'.

[NOTE]
Both the person and group should exist in the MeetingBook.
The person should also be an existing member of the group.

=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::updatedModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/meeting/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list and a `Group` list in `MeetingBook`, which `Person` can reference.
This would allow `MeetingBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, and one `Group` object per
unique `Group`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` and `Group` object.


=== Group feature

==== Current Implementation

.The new Group class
image::GroupClassDiagram.png[width="300"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/group/Group.java[`Group.java`]

The `Group`,

* is identified by `Title` and `Description`.
* contains the `Meeting` details for this particular group. This is an optional field.
* keeps track of its members in a `UniquePersonList`. The method `hasMember(Person person)` can check the enrollment of a particular `Person`.
* supports add and remove member using methods `addMember(Person toAdd)` and `removeMember(Person toRemove)`.
* exposes an unmodifiable `List<Person>` for observation of member enrollment status by `getMembersView()`.
* supports set and cancel of `Meeting` of this group by methods `setMeeting(Meeting meeting)` and `cancelMeeting()`.

==== Usage of Group class
A `Group` can be added and removed from `MeetingBook` using `addGroup` and `deleteGroup` command respectively.

Once the `Group` exists in the `AddressBook`, the existing `Person` can be assigned to that group using `join` command.
The person can also be removed from the group by `leave` command.

Each `Group` can keep track of a list of its members. This is supported by `UniquePersonList` class.

Each `Person` can also keep a list of groups he/she enrols in. An `UniqueGroupList` is added to support this functionality.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Management of group relationship

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `add` and `remove` operations support bidirectional update of relationships.
** Pros: Less complexity in current project structure.
** Cons: The future optimisation of these operations is less flexible.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a central `groupManager` to manage the group-person relationships on the `AddressBook level`.
** Pros: Greater room for possible future improvement, and ability to contain more complex relationships required by potential users.
** Cons: The idea is less compatible with the current project structure. Extensive change in structure and logic must be performed, and is error-prone.



=== UniqueGroupList feature

.The UniqueGroupList class
image::uniqueGroupListClassDiagram.png[width="500"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/group/UniqueGroupList.java[`UniqueGroupList.java`]

The `UniqueGroupList`,

* ensures a list of `Group` objects without duplicates.
* supports `add`, `remove` and `replace` operations on groups in the list.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Group>` for observation of the list.

[NOTE]
Both `UniqueGroupList` and `UniquePersonList` implements `Iterable` interface.



=== AddGroup and DeleteGroup feature
The AddGroup and DeleteGroup commands modify the `UniqueGroupList` in the `versionedAddressBook`.
This section shows how the addGroup and deleteGroup commands are implemented.

==== `addGroup` command usage
The `addGroup` command allows user to add a new group with user input title to the MeetingBook.
This command is executed with the following syntax: +

Syntax: `addGroup n/[Name]` +

Example: `addGroup n/CS2103T`: adds a new group with title 'CS2103T' into the MeetingBook.

*The follow sequence diagram shows how addGroup command functions.*

.Sequence diagram for addGroup command
image::AddGroupCommand.png[width="350"]


==== `deleteGroup` command usage
The `deleteGroup` command allows user to remove an existing group from the MeetingBook.
This command is executed with the following syntax: +

Syntax: `deleteGroup n/[Name]` +

Example: `deleteGroup n/CS2101`: removes the existing group with title 'CS2101' from the MeetingBook.

*The follow sequence diagram shows how deleteGroup command functions.*

.Sequence diagram for deleteGroup command
image::DeleteGroupCommand.png[width="350"]

==== Implementation of `addGroup` and `deleteGroup` commands
The `versionedAddressBook` maintains a `UniqueGroupList` to keep track of all groups
that exist in this MeetingBook. The commands thus modify and update this list of groups through `ModelManager`.



=== Join and Leave feature
The Join and Leave commands modify the relationship between groups existed in the `UniqueGroupList` and
people in the `UniquePersonList` maintained by `versionedAddressBook. This section provides description of the usage
and implementation of these commands.

==== `join` command usage
The `join` command updates relationship between a person and a group existed in the MeetingBook.
The person specified by name now becomes a member of the group specified by title.
This command is executed with the following syntax: +

Syntax: `join n/[Name] g/[Group]` +

Example: `join n/Derek g/CS2101`: makes the person 'Derek' become a member of group 'CS2101'

*The follow sequence diagram shows how join command functions.*

.Sequence diagram for join command
image::JoinCommand.png[width="500"]


==== `leave` command usage
The `leave` command updates relationship between person and group in the same way as the `join` command.
The person specified by name now stops to be a member of the group specified by title.
And the person is removed from this group. This command is executed with the following syntax: +

Syntax: `leave n/[Name] g/[Group]` +

Example: `leave n/Ben g/CS2103T`: removes the person `Ben` from the group `CS2103T`.

*The follow sequence diagram shows how leave command functions.*

.Sequence diagram for leave command

image::LeaveCommand.png[width="500"]

==== Implementation of `join` and `leave` commands
The `versionedAddressBook` maintains a `UniqueGroupList` to keep track of all groups that exist in this MeetingBook.
It also maintains a `UniquePersonList` to keep track of all people that exist in this MeetingBook.
The commands thus modify and update a pair of person and group, as specified by user input, in their respective list
through `ModelManager`.
