== PROJECT: CLInic

---

== 1. Introduction

This Project Portfolio Page documents my contributions to the development of `CLInic`, the product of a team of five
students from NUS School Of Computing as part of the `CS2103T Software Engineering` module. The main
features of the application are coded in `Java` while the GUI is handled by `JavaFX`, `HTML` and `CSS`.

`CLInic` is a desktop application made to manage and expedite operations in clinics. The main impetus behind `CLInic`
 was to distil the CLI's efficiency of typing commands, as its cryptic walls of text was intimidating to the
 general, non tech-savvy populous. Hence, `CLInic` marries the **simplistic design** and **efficient command issuing mechanism**
 of the CLI with an **intuitive** Graphical User Interface (GUI). This culminated in an application that is easy for
 **anyone** to use, all while providing the powerful functionalities and efficiencies offered by a CLI. +
 Below are some of the key features provided by `CLInic`:

* Allows users to manage patient and medicine information
* Allows users to easily generate documents to be issued by a clinic like `Medical Certificates` efficiently
* Provides intuitive workarounds to normally arduous but common administrative tasks such as restocking
and dispensing medicine

I played a major role in the development of the `Document` class, the relevant `Receipt`, `MedicalCertificate`
and `ReferralLetter` classes that extend it and the relevant patient management operations that are required for
them to work.

== 2. Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the `Document` class, its accompanying HTML template and
extending classes, which includes the `Receipt`, `MedicalCertificate` and `ReferralLetter` classes.
** What it does: It takes in the information of a document that is to be printed by the clinic and
generates a `HTML` file for it.
** Justification: This functionality simplifies the generation of documents that are required by the clinic.
This makes the administrative tasks in the clinic easier and faster, *boosting the productivity of its users*,
 translating into *shorter wait times at the clinic for the patients*.
** Highlights: This functionality allows for *seamless transfer of information from doctors to receptionists*
of the clinic during consultation, which when coupled with the fast retrieval of information from the
application's database of `Patient` and `Medicine` information, makes for *efficient generation of relevant
documents*.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Improved and helped with the implementation of `ServedPatient` and `ServedPatientListManager`, which are intermediate
abstractions(placeholders) that help to 'finalise' the information to be used for the generation of `Document`.
** Integrated `MedicalCertificate` with the `DocumentAddContentCommand`.
** Designed the `HTML` template which all the classes that extend `Document` use to format their information.
