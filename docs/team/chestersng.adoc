== PROJECT: CLInic

---

== 1. Overview

This project portfolio serves to document my contributions to CLInic, a CS2103T (Introduction to Software Engineering) project, as part of my Computer Science curriculum in NUS.

CLInic is a desktop application made for clinics. The CLI in CLInic stands for Command Line Interface, which is the main method to use this application. CLInic also has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to display information in a structured and user-friendly manner. This application uses Java as the primary programming language and uses JavaFX, HTML and CSS for the GUI.

The project scope for CLInic is to morph the given `addressbook-level4` into a clinic management application that allows users to manage patient and medicine information and additionally manage the clinic queue.

My task in CLInic is to implement a *Patient Queue Management System*, as well as to integrate the changes of my team to ensure CLInic works after every enhancement or change.

== 2. Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implementation of *Patient Queue Management System (PQMS)*
** What it does: This system allows the clinic to keep track of the queue in the clinic.
** Justification: This system improves the product significantly because it has created another use case for this application apart from just storing patient and medicine information.
** Highlights: This system builds upon patient information and medicine information. It models the real life queue system in the clinic and the commands are made to be as intuitive as possible.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Integration of `Patient` and `Document` class with PQMS through `DocumentAddCommand` and `DocumentDisplayCommand`
** Integration of `Patient` and `Medicine` class through `DispenseMedicineCommand`
