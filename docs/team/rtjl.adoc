== 1. Overview

This portfolio documents my contributions to modsUni, a software engineering module project. This module was
taken in my second year during the first semester.

modsUni was developed by a team of five over a period of seven weeks. It is a desktop application made for
local undergraduates to quickly generate a schedule. The schedule will contain a list of modules to take in
 each semester, throughout their entire university candidature. modsUni is also designed for users who
 prefer typing commands instead of using a mouse to interact with the application.

=== Generate schedule: `generate`
Generates a schedule based on the modules that has been added using `addModuleS` command. +
Format: `generate`

[IMPORTANT]
This command can only be executed when logged in using a student account.

Example: +

* To generate a schedule successfully, follow the following steps:
. `addModuleS CS1010 CS2030 CS2040 CS2103T`
. `generate` +
The schedule will be displayed as shown in figure 1 below.

+
image::generateSuccess.png[width="600"]
_Figure 1. An example of a schedule_

+

[NOTE]
If the command has executed successfully, the message in the red box will say "Generate success!".



There are instances where the command will fail to generate a schedule. The following is a list of
possible reasons why a failure might occur and the steps required to resolve it.

Examples of possible failures: +

* Missing prerequisites
+
The following message in figure 2 will be shown for this failure.
+

image::generateMissingPrereq.png[width="700"]
_Figure 2. Error message shown when there are prerequisites are missing._

+
Steps to rectify:

. Execute `showModule CS2030` to identify the missing prerequisite module as shown in figure 3.
+
image::generateMissingPrereqShow.png[width="700"]
_Figure 3. Output of the `showModule CS2030` command._
+
[NOTE]
The prerequisites are shown in the red box.


. Add the missing prerequisite module using `addModuleS CS1010`.
. Run the `generate` command again.
. Verify the application's output with the figure 4 as shown below. The green box should show the schedule
and
message in
the red box should say "Generate success!".
+

* No modules added to staged list
+
The following message in figure 5 will be shown for this failure.
+

image::generateNoStagedModules.png[width="700"]
_Figure 5. Error message shown when there are no modules in the staged list._

+
Steps to rectify:

. Add a module to your staged list using `addModuleS CS1010`.
. Execute `switch tab/staged` to ensure that the module has been successfully added to your staged list.
+

=== Generate Schedule Feature

This feature is for student users to generate a schedule containing the modules to take in each semester
during their entire university candidature. It is executed using the `generate` command.

[NOTE]
The `generate` command can only be executed by users of type `Student`.

The section below will describe in detail the current implementation and design considerations of the
`generate` command.

==== Current Implementation
The sequence diagram shown below in Figure 8 illustrates the interactions between some of these components
 when the command is executed.

image::SequenceDiagramforGenerate.png[width="200]
_Figure 8. High Level Sequence Diagram for `generate` command_

The command is facilitated by the following classes:

* `Generate` command class +
The `Generate` command class extends from the `Command` class. Figure 9 below depicts the UML
diagram for the `Generate` command class.

+
image::GenerateCommandUML.png[width="250]
_Figure 9. Generate command UML Diagram_

* `Model` class +
The following methods in the `Model` class are used in this command:

** `isStudent()` +
This method checks if the current user is a student.
** `canGenerate()` +
This method checks if it is possible to generate a schedule.
** `generateSchedule()` +
This method generates a schedule.

* `Generate` from the `Logic` package. +
This class is used to encapsulate the processes for generating a schedule. The following methods are used
in this command: +
** `canGenerate(Student)` +
This methods checks if all the module prerequisites from the student's staged list is met. It does this by
merging the staged and taken module list together. +
Using the merged list, it extracts out the list of module codes. Each module in the staged list is checked
to see if the prerequisite condition can be met. The following code snippet shows this process:
+
[source, java]
----
public static Optional<List<Code>> canGenerate(Student student) {
    List<Code> cannotTakeCode = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Code> codeChecklist = student.getTakenAndStageCode();
    UniqueModuleList modulesStaged = student.getModulesStaged();
    for (Module module : modulesStaged) {
        if (!module.checkPrereq(codeChecklist)) {
            cannotTakeCode.add(module.getCode());
        }
    }
    // return list of codes that failed to met prerequisite condition or an empty value if the list is empty.
}
----
** `generateSchedule()` +
This method will create a schedule using modules that are in the student's staged list. +
It does this by going though the list of modules and removing those that satisfies the prerequisite condition. As it removes,
the module code is added to a temporary list. This list is used during the checking of prerequisite
conditions for the remaining modules. +
The following code snippet will provide a clearer explanation of how the method works:
+
[source, java]
----
public SemesterList generateSchedule() {
    SemesterList semesterList = new SemesterList();
    Semester newSemester = new Semester();

    List<Code> taken = new ArrayList<>();

    while (modulesStaged.size() > 0) {
        for (Module element : modulesStaged) {
            if (element.checkPrereq(taken)) {
                // Remove module from staged list
                // Add module to semester and temporary list
            }
        }

        semesterList.addSemester(newSemester);
        newSemester = new Semester();
    }
    return semesterList;
}
----

[NOTE]
This class is different from the `Generate` command class. The command class is for the execution of the
command, while the current one is for creating the schedule.

===== Execution phase of the `generate` command
Figure 10 below shows an overview of the steps performed during the execution phase of the command.

image::SDforGenerateCommandLogicAndModel.png[width="250]
_Figure 10. Sequence diagram for the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` Components when executing
 `generate`._

In the execute method of the command, the following checks are performed:

. Type of user account +
This step checks if a user has logged in and the current user is a student. It is performed as only student
accounts are able to generate a schedule.

. Modules in staged list +
This step ensures that there modules are available to add into the schedule.

. Staged modules prerequisites +
This step verifies that the prerequisites for all modules in the staged list are met. It is done to ensure
 that it is possible to generate a schedule.

If any of the checks fails, an error will be thrown. The following code snippet illustrates the
checking process: +
[source, java]
----
if (model.getCurrentUser() == null) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_ERROR);
}

if (!model.isStudent()) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_INVALID_ROLE);
}

if (!currentStudent.hasModuleToTake()) {
    throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_NO_MODULES);
}

if (cannotTakeCodes.isPresent()) {
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_FAILURE + cannotTakeCodes.toString());
}
----
After passing all the checks, the command will proceed on and generate a schedule. To display the schedule
in the user interface, two events will be created.

. `MainWindowClearResourceEvent` +
It is created to inform the current panel in the main window to clear it's resources.
. `NewGenerateResultAvailableEvent` +
This event will show the generated schedule in the main window.

These events will be sent to `EventsCenter` to process and execute it.

===== Example scenario of the generate command
Given below is an example usage scenario of how the generate command behaves:

The user launches the application for the first time and the `currentUser` will at this point be `null`.
Issuing the generate command at this point will throw an error message indicating to the user that they have
not registered an account or they are currently not logged in.

In order to utilise the generate command, the user must perform one of the following options:

* The user executes `register user/demo ...` to register a new `Student` account, followed by `addModuleS
cs1010`.

* The user executes `login user/demo pass/P@ssw0rd` to log into account, followed by `addModuleS cs1010`.

[NOTE]
A new `Student` would be initialized and automatically set as the `currentUser`. The module cs1010 would
also be added to the student's staged module list, enabling the student to perform generate command. +

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Placement of methods for generating a schedule
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a separate `Generate` class in the `Logic` package to
encapsulate the processes for generating a schedule.
** Pros: Modification made to the generating of schedule does not affect the `Student` model.
** Cons: This approach adds complexity to the design of the application.
* **Alternative 2:** Adding the logic for generating the schedule to the `Student` model.
** Pros: This alternative is easier to implement.
** Cons: It breaks the single responsibility principle of the `Student` model.

===== Aspect: Checking of prerequisites before generating a schedule
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Perform checks to ensure that all prerequisites for modules in staged
 list are fulfilled.
 ** Pros: Ensures that the command will not cause an infinite loop.
 ** Cons: The command will not always be able to generate a schedule as students may forget to add in the
 prerequisite modules.
* **Alterative 2:** Assume that prerequisites for all modules are met.
** Pros: Reduces the time complexity of the command.
** Cons: The command might end up with an infinite loop as it keeps on trying to arrange the modules.
