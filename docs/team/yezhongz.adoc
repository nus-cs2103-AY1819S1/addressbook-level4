== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: enpowers the app with *the ability to sync with Google Calendar*
** What it does: In Google Calendar mode, when the user  `add` / `edit` /`delete`/`clear` the local Events, same effect will be applied to the Google Calendar in real time.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user might want to obtain local events events from Google instead of using a blank local databse, and to interact with Google Calendar thereafter. This enhancement efffectively turns the app to be a Command Line Controlled version of Google Calendar.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects almost all existing commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives and the links among the commands. The implementation was extremeley challenging as it required full understanding of both local implementation as well as Google implementation. For each and every command, many format convertions are required.
** Credits: Google APIs are heavily used in this project because intensive interaction with Google Calendar is required.

* *Minor enhancement 1*: added a check to allow user use the app in offline without any error, before the initialization of Google Calendar. The app only enters Google Calendar Mode (with sync with Goolge Calendar feastures all enabled) after the user explicites type the command.
* *Minor enhancement 2*: added a welcome page and automatically becomes the log-in page after 45 seconds. This added feature allows more interaction with the user.
