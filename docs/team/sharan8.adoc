== PROJECT: _SocialCare_

---

== Overview
This project portfolio page serves to document my contributions to _SocialCare_, a *software engineering project* that was
undertaken as part of the National University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing's beginner Software Engineering
module, CS2103T. More information on this module can be found
https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-website/admin/index.html[here].

_SocialCare_ is an *event and volunteer management system* for administrators of social welfare organisations, which runs on desktops.
The user interacts with it using the Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
created using https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/overview/jfxpub-overview.htm[JavaFX]. The application is written in Java,
and has about 10,000 lines of code.

Key Features of _SocialCare_:

* Add, remove and store volunteers and events.
* Assign volunteers to events.
* Create event records for each volunteer consisting of the event and volunteer IDs, hours contributed and related
remarks.
* Export a PDF certificate detailing a volunteer’s involvement with the organisation (event records, contributed hours).

Through the use of the CLI, _SocialCare_ enables the above functionalities to be executed faster than a typical
mouse/GUI driven application.

== Summary of contributions

This section summarizes my contributions to this project and to my fellow course mates throughout the course of the module. It includes enhancements made and a link to the code that I contributed as well.

* *Major enhancement*: I added *the ability to export volunteer certificates in PDF format.*
** _What it does_: This feature allows the user to export a volunteer’s event records and contributed hours in the form
of a PDF certificate.
** _Justification_: This feature improves the product significantly as it automates a task that is currently done manually by referencing files of volunteer records and painstakingly entering information into a word document. It also offers the user a way to access information from outside of the application as well (via portable
and printable PDF files).
** _Highlights_: This enhancement involved an in-depth analysis of available external open source libraries, and
meticulous design of the PDF document to be exported.
** _Credits_: This feature was developed with the use of https://pdfbox.apache.org/team.html[Apache PDFBox], which
provides the functionality to create and write to PDF files.

* *Minor enhancement*: I added the *total volunteer count to the status bar*. This enhancement is in line with our
application’s intention to provide the user with easy access to useful information pertaining to volunteers.

* *Code contributed*: Here is a https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=sharan8[link]
to my code on the Project Code Dashboard.

** Documentation:
*** Revised the introduction sections of the
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W16-2/main/blob/master/README.adoc[README] and
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W16-2/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[Developer Guide] ({pullURL}/109[#109])
** Community:
*** Reviewed PRs (with non-trivial review comments): {pullURL}/92[#92], {pullURL}/107[#107], {pullURL}/114[#114], {pullURL}/232[#232]
*** Involved forum members in the resolution of a design consideration: https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/forum/issues/114[#114]
*** Shared a personal learning point with forum members: https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/forum/issues/143[#143]
*** Provided inspiration for the implementation of the import/export csv/xml feature, specifically through my handling of file export to main and backup filepaths in the `exportcert` feature I added.
** Tools:
*** Integrated a third party library (https://pdfbox.apache.org/index.html[Apache PDFBox]) to the project
({pullURL}/161[#161]).
** Project conceptualisation:
*** Set up and managed a shared
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19iV64xK0EwaV8kjMaP72P1G7iGKKXtEX2my5M-QowKc/edit?usp=sharing[Brainstorming Canvas]
to brainstorm on product morphing ideas using the 'Target User Profile-Problem-Value Proposition' framework.
*** Conceptualised and validated the idea for _SocialCare_ through conversing with staff from 2
social welfare organisations that I have worked with in the past, who are part of our intended target group.
*** Contacted a software engineer from the industry to find out how Extreme Programming is actually employed, and shared the takeaways with my group and classmates.
