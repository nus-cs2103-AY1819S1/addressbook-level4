LostBUTFound has a graphical user interface built with JavaFX but most of the user interactions are done using command line interface. It is written in Java and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to resolve articles*
** What it does: It allows the user to resolve articles once it have been claimed by the owner. Resolved articles would still be stored for logging purposes and can be deleted using the `delete` command, but they cannot be edited. Resolved articles would also not appear in the list unless the `findresolved` command is executed.
** Justification: This feature helps users keep track of both resolved and unresolved articles. If there are claim disputes for articles that have previously been claimed, the administrator could find find the resolved article easily in LostBUTFound.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the ability to find articles based on specific fields*
