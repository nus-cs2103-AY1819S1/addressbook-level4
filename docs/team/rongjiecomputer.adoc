== PROJECT: ModulePlanner

---

== Overview

This is a project portfolio about a team project called Module Planner when taking CS2103T,
Software Engineering.

Module Planner is a desktop module planning application to help National University of Singapore (NUS) Computer Science students
figuring out what modules in order to graduate. The user interacts with it using a Command Line
Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.

The main features are the adding and deleting of modules, as well as the suggesting of
new modules that the user can take based on their academic requirements.

== Role

* Developer
* Storage code owner

== Summary of contributions
=== Major enhancement
* Implement mechanism to retrieve NUS academic major and module information
** What it does: Pre-process academic major and module information from https://nusmods.com[NUSMods],
convert it into JSON format and package it into the JAR file for use of the application.
** Justification: All main commands in Module Planner (`add`, `delete`, `suggest` and `status`) rely on
information about NUS academic majors and modules to function.
** Highlight:
*** This requires a clear understanding of the types of information about academic major and module
as well as how they relate with each other so that they can be represented as well-designed classes.
*** Scripting experience is needed to pre-process the data from external sources so that it can be easily
manipulated in application code.
*** Need to strike a balance between the potential implementation complexity of other commands and the accuracy
of the processed data to meet NUS students' expectation.

=== Minor enhancements
* Implement the ability to sort module suggestion based on user's academic major requirement.
(https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T16-4/main/pull/190[#190])
* Implement the ability to read and write module planner data in JSON file format.
* Co-author `setup` command with Gabriel Yik to initialize user's academic major and focus areas.
