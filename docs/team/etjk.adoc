== PROJECT: modsUni

== 1. Overview

This portfolio documents my contribution to the project - *modsUni*.
modsUni is an open-sourced project that was collaborated with 4 other coursemates from the module CS2103 (Introduction to Software Engineering).

Project *modsUni* is a desktop application that was developed in 6 weeks which allowed us to practice our software engineering skills in a short time frame.
This project aims to accelerate the process of planning a candidature for a university student.
It was developed for users who prefer to interact with a Command Line Interface (CLI) over a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
We have managed to contribute ~27,000 lines of code to a code base of 10,000 lines of code.
Currently, we are targeting undergraduates from the National University of Singapore (NUS), and plan to expand to other local universities.

My contributions include the implementation of saving a user's information securely into a local file and restoring the user's information into the application using the saved file.

== 2. Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: This enhancement added functionality to save and load a user's (admin or student) data.

** What it does:
*** Allows a user to save their information as a local file on the disk.
*** Allows returning users to restore their information using the previously saved file.
*** Encrypts a user's information by default during the saving process.
*** Displays the saved information upon issue the save command.

** Justification: Improves the user experience of modsUni significantly by having the ability to save their information locally onto a disk, allowing them to restore their data during the login process.

** Highlights: Puts confidentiality in high regard with multiple security concerns raised and discussed prior to implementation. The inbuilt security feature was also made robust to prevent users from being frustrated.

* *Minor enhancement*: This enhancement added functionality to enable a user to navigate between different tabs within the application using CLI.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=etjk[Functional code]]
