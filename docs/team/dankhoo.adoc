== PROJECT: SSENISUB

---

Hello! I am Daniel Khoo. Year 2, Computer Science Student at National University of Singapore (NUS). This project
portfolio serves to document what I have contributed to the project SSENISUB, a Software Engineering project (CS2103).

== Overview

SSENISUB is a desktop business management application designed to manage staffs' information within an organisation.
SSENISUB is built by a team of 5 students namely Daniel Khoo, Terence Goh, Ashburn Tan, Ngeow Xiu Qi and Valensia
Sebastiani.

* Features of SSENISUB:
** Allows staff to find contact information of their co-staff and supervisor easily.
** Allows staff to set privacy on their sensitive information such as phone number and home address.
** Allows HR to add/edit/delete contact information.
** Allows manager to give rating and feedback on their staff's performance.
** Allows manager to favourite the staff to place it on top of the list.

User interacts with SSENISUB mainly using the Command Line Interface (CLI). +

My main responsibility in this project is to enhance the commands (`add`, `edit`, `find`) +

I also played a key role in designing the UI, to make a better experience for the user on the whole. The UI was also
further improved to display the details of the staff. A few UI event triggers have also been implemented. The picture
below shows the main page of SSENISUB.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Application. They showcase my ability to write and manage the code
within the project._
|===

* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=dankhoo[RepoSense]

* *Major enhancement 1*: Added the ability to *add staff*
** What it does: HR staff can add staff with this feature.
** Justification: This feature provides HR department a better management of staffs in the organisation.
** Highlights: This enhancement adds new commands into the application, and requires in-depth analysis of design
analysis with regards to information storage. In the upcoming v2.0, users with different level of authorisations
are only allowed to use certain commands, this command would only be accessible to HR department.

* *Major enhancement 2*: Added the ability to *edit existing staff*
** What it does: This feature allows the staff and HR staff to make any amendments to any staff they have created
previously in the SSENISUB.
** Justification: HR staff could add the staff with the wrong information, this feature will allow the HR staff
to make any edits to the staff's information. In addition, information such as phone number or home address or
manager can change over time thus, this feature will allow staff to make any edits only to their own information.
** Highlights: This enhancement delete and re-create a new Person object. In the upcoming v2.0, users with different
level of authorisations are only allowed to use certain commands, this command would only be accessible to HR
department and staff itself.

* *Major enhancement 3*: Added the ability to *find existing staff*
** What it does: This feature allows all users to find existing staff in the list with only name, email,
department and manager parameters.
** Justification: This feature will help users to find any particular staff information easily instead of scrolling
through the long list of staff. Also, when a staff is planning for an event for the department and needs a list of
names, this feature will be able to find all staff according to the department. Lastly, in the event when a manager
needs to give a rating or feedback to the staff, he can find all staff that is under him so that he will not
overlook on any staff.
** Highlights: This enhancement changes the `INDEX` accordingly in the User Interface. Any command that relies on
`INDEX` needs to keep it in mind.
