== PROJECT: HealthBase

== 1. Overview

|===
|HealthBase is an application that evolved from a brown-field project, AddressBook,
  which consisted of 10KLOC. Over the course of 3 months, my team has gradually morphed the AddressBook into
  HealthBase by fortnightly meeting milestones that we set in the infancy stages of the project.
|===

This page encompasses my contributions to HealthBase. This includes the implementation of features, refactoring
and documentation.

HealthBase is a desktop application designed to aid in the management of a hospital. It provides patient data
input and management capabilities through a command-line interface for input and a graphical user interface for data display.
Its main features (among others) include:

* Patient registration into the HealthBase system
* Patient dietary restriction(s) data entry and retrieval
* Patient medication data entry and retrieval
* Patient medical history data entry and retrieval
* Patient visitor history data entry and retrieval
* Real-time management of the number of visitors any given patient has
* Patient appointment management for nurses
* Patient discharge from the hospital
* Patient check in for subsequent visits

== 2. Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added `addappt` command
** What it does: adds an appointment for a given patient. Each appointment includes the following information: type of procedure, procedure name, date and time of appointment and the Doctor-in-charge
** Justification: this command provides a core functionality of the HealthBase (appointment data entry and retrieval).
** Highlights: This feature currently allows for nurses to add and view upcoming appointments for patients. In V2.0 of
HealtBase, doctors will be able to view the appointments they have with different patients.
* *Minor enhancement*: Incorporate `appt` with the `view` command
