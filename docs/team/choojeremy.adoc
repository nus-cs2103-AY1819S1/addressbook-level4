== PROJECT: OASIS

---

== Overview

Office Assistance Specialized Integration System (OASIS) is an all-in-one app for companies to manage employee's leave applications, projects and user accounts for each employee. OASIS uses a CLI interface.

This project portfolio summarizes my contributions to the project in terms of coding, documentation for both develoeprs and end-users, as well as testing.

== Summary of contributions

The following section shows my major code contributions to OASIS.

=== Major enhancement: User accounts

* *Major enhancement*: Added *full fledged functionality for user accounts.*
** What it does: Allows each employee to identify themselves with a username and password, similar to most modern systems. It provides:
*** *Username and Password* implementation for each employee.
*** Ability to *login and logout* into each employee's accounts.
*** A way to *secure the employee's account* through the changing of passwords.
*** Complete modern-day security using *salted and hashed passwords* with 256-byte salts and SHA512 hashing algorithm.
** Justification: It is critical to ensure the privacy of employees by keeping their private information secure and only viewable by specific people. Thus, this feature allows the use of user accounts to verify that there is appropriate authorization, ensuring that employee data isn't publicly viewable.
** Highlights: The password command requires large changes to ensure that passwords input by the user aren't viewable through the history command. To solve this gacefully, I implemented a feature for `LogicManager` to have a List of interceptors, which are a `FunctionalInterface` that allows the processing of a Command. This allows the password changing command to work without adding excessive coupling between `Command` and `LogicManager`. Security for each user was essental to ensure that a user cannot read commands entered by another user. This was implemented by clearing user-specific data after logout.

=== Minor enhancement:
The following section shows all the other minor enhancements done for the project that are not part of my major enhancement above.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Set up the project on GitHub, including the creation of the organization, labels, auto-publishing of docs, and the https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4/pull/86[team PR]
*** Managed releases `v1.0` - `v1.4` (5 releases) on GitHub
*** Set up RepoSense for the group, allowing for code to be properly attributed https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-1/main/pull/35[#35]

** Documentation:
*** Provided updates to the User Guide: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-1/main/pull/125[#125]
*** Updated documentation based on errors I encountered and how to resolve it to help future contributors https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-1/main/pull/2[#2]

** PR standards:
*** All of my pull requests have referenced clearly to which issues they're attempt to address and have resulted in no loss of code coverage. Major examples: (https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-1/main/pull/84[#84] https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-1/main/pull/106[#106] https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-1/main/pull/118[#118])

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Allow for easier searching of employees by updated the find command to support `*` and `_` as wildcards.
*** Converted the parser to use `-` instead of `/` to read arguments, similar to the command line in modern day operating systems.

** Community:
*** Contributed to forum discussions (example:  https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/forum/issues/74#issuecomment-428847858[1], https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/forum/issues/146[2])
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-2/main/issues/108[1] https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-2/main/issues/173[2] https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-2/main/issues/174[3])

** Tools:
*** Integrated Travis CI, AppVeyor and Coveralls to the team repo
