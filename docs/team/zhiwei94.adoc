== PROJECT: NUS Hangs

---

== Overview

NUS Hangs is a desktop Schedule Manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). It is a Java application written by developers of F11-4, to target small/mid-size interest/study groups in NUS.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Enhance person features to fit requirements of NUS Hangs:
** `add`: Add a person to NUS Hangs with optional inputs. +
This feature improves the product accessibility because the user has the option to leave out certain inputs.

** `find`: Find all persons in NUS Hangs, provided by prefix(es). +
This feature allows users to find any persons in Nus Hangs, with improved prefix search to widen/narrow search results.

** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
