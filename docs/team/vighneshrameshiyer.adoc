== PROJECT: U-Schedule

---

== Overview

U-Schedule is a desktop calendar application for university students written for the project for the module CS2103
Software Engineering. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX for user feedback. It
 is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *fuzzy search with filters*
** What it does: Allows the user to search for commands without having to type the exact matching words - e.g. "find event proj" to find a calendar event with "Project" in its name. Also allows the user to filter their search by date and time, and by tags, for more precise searching. Finally, it displays the most relevant results first.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows users to search for events more conveniently and more precisely. This would improve the overall user experience as well as the ease of navigation for users of U-Schedule, since the search function also makes the edit and select functions more convenient.
** Highlights: This feature expands upon the existing find command in Address Book (Level 4), by revamping the Parser and Model to allow extra functionality (filtering by multiple Predicates and Sorting). This feature has the potential to be extended further, to allow users to filter the search by even more criteria or to incorporate more fine-grained filtering with boolean logic.
** Credits: Uses third party library https://github.com/xdrop/fuzzywuzzy[fuzzywuzzy] for the fuzzy search

* *Minor enhancement*: added feature that switches the GUI to the appropriate tab - either To Do List or Calendar Events - when a todo or event command is entered respectively
