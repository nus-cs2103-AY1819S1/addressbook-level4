== PROJECT: Lost and Found

---

== Overview

LostBUTFound is a desktop application used for managing lost and found articles.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add images into an article*
** What it does: allows the user add an image into an article.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can add images to an article hence, ease them in differentiating two items and knowing which one is theirs and making more sense of finding and differentiate our system with the simple logbook based lost and found
** Highlights: This feature

* *Minor enhancement*: added a *Sequence* class
** What it does: Allow creation of unique id.
** Justification: unique id is needed to create a file / id without any collision, hence this is perfect for Image class, by using this as image is not replaced, image is not written in the xml file in Base64 or any other encoding but can still be undoable.
** Highlight: Singleton is used in this Sequence class and made me realized the ingenuity of singleton.
** Credit: inspiration from how postgresql handles their unique id by having a table specifically made for keeping track what is the last number dispatched into the tables.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=plty&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-10&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[RepoSense Report]]
