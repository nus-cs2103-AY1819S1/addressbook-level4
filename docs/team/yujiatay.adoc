This portfolio outlines my contributions to the project Anakin.

== PROJECT: Anakin

---

Project Anakin is the brainchild of team T09-2 which comprises myself, Joel Lee, Foo Guo Wei, David Goh and Nguyen
Trong Truong Thanh. We completed it in November 2018 as part of a Software Engineering module (CS2103T) in the
National University of Singapore.

== Overview

Anakin is a desktop flashcard management application created by team T09-2 to solve the inherent problems associated
with physical flashcards. It aims to facilitate quick and intuitive management of virtual flashcards as well as the
sharing of flashcard decks. Additionally, it features the ability to rate the difficulty of individual flashcards
and a scheduling algorithm that prompts reviews of cards based on their difficulty rating.

The user interacts with Anakin using a command line interface, and has a GUI created with JavaFX. Anakin is written
in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

This section acts as a summary of my contributions to project Anakin.

* *Major enhancement*: I added *the ability to review decks*
** What it does: allows the user to review the flashcards in the deck one by one.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will want to be able to look through
 his flashcards stored in our application. It is also important to be able to view the question and answer
 separately as this is used as a revision tool.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. While in the review
mode, the user is not allowed to make any changes to his decks and cards, except for classifying his performance for
each card. The implementation of this enhancement involves notable UI changes to switch out the screen for editing
decks with a different screen specially created for reviewing flashcards.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Enhanced UI component by introducing a new screen for reviewing flashcards and adding a panel for displaying
flashcards in decks.
** Implemented a `editcard` command that allows user to update the details of their flashcard which include the
question and answer.
** Successfully integrated the different components of the application (i.e. Model, Logic, Storage and UI) and produced
 the first working prototype.

=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::AnakinUIClassDiagram.png[width="400"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DeckEditScreen`,
`DeckReviewScreen`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. The `DeckEditScreen` is in turn made up of `DeckListPanel` and
`CardListPanel` and the `DeckReviewScreen` is made up of `DeckReviewCard`. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.
