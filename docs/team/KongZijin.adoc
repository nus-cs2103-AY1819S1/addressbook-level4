== PROJECT: TheTracker (v1.3)

---

== Overview

The Tracker (v1.3) is a desktop application that helps NUS students to monitor contacts, modules and events.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: *Improved existing edit function to edit any type of entry.
** What it does: allows the user to edit a person, module or occasion by index
** Justification: This is one of the basic features of TheTracker, which allows a user to edit module and occasion in a
similar way of how he edit a person in his address book.
** Highlights: This feature is necessary for a user to simultaneously maintain all three types of entries.
** Credits: This enhancement required the different lists to be handled independently, but with all actions tracked simultaneously (e.g. for undo/redo).

* *Minor enhancement*: Implement the `Occasion` class and its related classes(`OccasionName`, `OccasionDate`, `OccasionLocation`)
