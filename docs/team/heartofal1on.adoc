== PROJECT: iScheduler Xs Max

---

== Overview

iScheduler Xs Max is a desktop scheduler application morphed from the original
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[Address Book sample application (Level 4)]. As its name
suggests, it is used for scheduling events. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with
JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 175 kLoC (Java code comprises 21 kLoC of it).

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to have auto-completion of commands*
** What it does: allows the user to have the ability to invoke a particular commands by suggested auto-completion(s).
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because some command names can be a little long and
having auto-completion of the command name should provide a convenient way to invoke the command.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth
analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required the knowledge of a method named
`TextFields.bindAutoCompletion()` from an external library called
https://bitbucket.org/controlsfx/controlsfx/[ControlsFX]. See
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/scheduler/ui/CommandBox.java#CommandBox()[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`].
** Credits: _Goh Cheng Yu (GitHub: link:https://github.com/chengyuuu[@Chengyuuu]) and Tan Ying Zi Rebecca
(GitHub: link:https://github.com/rebstan97[@rebstan97]) for contributing their ideas as well as teaching me how to one
of the ways of how to use auto-completion in Java._
* *Minor enhancement*: added *command aliases* that allows the user to use aliases to invoke commands.
