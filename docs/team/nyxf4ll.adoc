Welcome to Pakorn Ueareeworakul's Portfolio!

Here you can find details on my contributions to various Software Engineering projects. Specifically, this portfolio contains links to functional and test code I wrote, and excerpts from technical documentation I created.

== PROJECT: MeetingBook

MeetingBook is a desktop scheduler application targeted at university students involved in multiple Co-Curricular Activities and Project-Based modules. The application is a modified contact book with features to group contacts and assign meetings to such groups. MeetingBook is written by a team of 5 students from National University of Singapore's School of Computing. It is forked from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level4] written by https://se-edu.github.io/[SE-EDU].

=== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to schedule/cancel meetings*
** What it does: allows the user to add/remove meetings from the specified group.
** Justification: This feature is essential to morph the AddressBook into a meetingscheduler.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires major modifications to the Model and addition of new classes such as https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/meeting/Meeting.java[Meeting] and https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/meeting/TimeStamp.java[TimeStamp]. The implementation is also challenging as it requires extensive coordination between team members due to the level of dependency it has on the group feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=nyxf4ll&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-05&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[code]]

=== Contributions to the User Guide

|_Shown below are my contributions to the User Guide. They demonstrates my ability to write documentation and manuals targeting end-users._
|===

==== Schedule meetings: `meet`

To schedule a meeting, use the `meet` command.

Format: `meet GROUP_NAME n/MEETING_NAME t/MEETING_TIME l/MEETING_LOCATION d/MEETING_DESCRIPTION`

* Schedules a meeting with the group `GROUP_NAME`
* Either all or none of the fields must be provided.
* In case that none of the fields is provided, the command will cancel the meeting associated with the group.
* Scheduling a new meeting to the same group overwrites the old meeting.

[NOTE]
`MEETING_TIME` is specified in the format `dd-mm-yyyy@hh:mm`

Examples:

* Example 1:
1. `meet Presentation2101 n/Demo Rehearsal t/26-10-2018@12:30 l/COM1-0218 d/Meeting for Project Demo` +
(This schedules the meeting) +
+
2. `list meeting` +
(This displays the list of meetings)

* Example 2:
1. `meet Presentation2101 n/Demo Rehearsal t/26-10-2018@12:30 l/COM1-0218 d/Meeting for Project Demo` +
(This schedules the meeting) +
+
2. `list meeting` +
(This displays `Demo Rehearsal` as the meeting associated with `Presentation 2101`) +
+
3. `meet Presentation2101 n/Discussion on Slides t/26-10-2018@12:30 l/COM1-0218 d/Some slides are wrong` +
(This overwrites `Demo Rehearsal` with `Discussion on Slides`) +
+
4. `list meeting` (`Emergency Meeting` is displayed instead of `Demo Rehearsal`)

* Example 3:
1. `meet OtherGroup ...` +
(This fails because `OtherGroup` is not in the MeetingBook)

[NOTE]
It is assumed that the group `Presentation2101` is present and is the only group in the MeetingBook and has no meeting as of the moment before each example starts.

==== Cancel meetings: `cancel`

To cancel a meeting, use the `cancel` command.

Format: `cancel GROUP_NAME`

Example:

* `cancel Project2103` (This cancels the meeting with `Project2103`)

* `cancel Project2103` +
`cancel Project2103` (This fails because the meeting is already cancelled)

[NOTE]
It is assumed that the group `Project2103` is present in the MeetingBook and has a meeting.

[NOTE]
calling `meet GROUP_NAME` without argument is equivalent to calling `cancel GROUP_NAME`.

=== Meeting Feature

`Meeting` is one of the central feature of this application. It allows the user to create a reminder of an upcoming event associated with a `Group`.

[NOTE]
A `Group` can only have a maximum of one `Meeting` at any given time.

==== Current implementation

In the current implementation, `Meeting` is related to `Group` by composition. To facilitate the meeting feature, `Group` implements the following operations:

* `Group#hasMeeting` -- This returns `true` if there is a meeting associated with the group
* `Group#getMeeting()` -- This group's meeting or `null` if the group has no meeting.
* `Group#setMeeting(Meeting meeting)` -- This assigns `meeting` to the group.
* `Group#cancelMeeting()` -- This removes the meeting associated witht the group.

These operations can be accessed by retreiving the list of groups using `Model#getGroupList()` and performing these operations on its members.

**Given below is an example usage scenario and how the model behaves at each step.**

Step 1. The user launches the application. For simplicity, we assume that the groups `Project2103`, `Presentation` and `FrisbeeTeam` are present in the meeting book. None of these groups have a meeting scheduled.

[NOTE]
Meeting field in a group without a meeting is an empty `Optional`

Step 2. The user executes `meet FrisbeeTeam n/Sunday Practice t/28-10-2018@10:00 l/UTown Green d/Practice for Inter-College Games` to schedule a meeting named `Sunday Practice` associated with the group `FrisbeeTeam`.

Step 3. The user then executes `meet Project2103 n/Weekly Meeting...` to schedule a meeting called `Weekly Meeting` with the `Project2103` Group.

image::meetCommandStep3Diagram.png[width="600"]

Step 4. The user then found out that the meeting `Sunday Practice` with `FrisbeeTeam` has been cancelled. Thus, the user calls `cancel FrisbeeTeam` to cancel meeting with the `FrisbeeTeam` group.

[NOTE]
Calling `cancel` on a group without meeting returns an error

[NOTE]
calling `meet GROUP_NAME` without argument is equivalent to calling `cancel GROUP_NAME`.

Step 5. The user then discovers that the topic of the meeting with `Project2103` changed to rehearsal for the upcoming software demo. Therefore, the user calls `meet Project2103 n/Demo Preparation...` to change the detail of the meeting This overwrites the meeting `Weekly Meeting` with the new meeting `Demo Preparation`.

[NOTE]
This operation creates a new `Meeting` object which replaces the old one.

**The following sequence diagrams show how the meet and cancel command function.**

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storage of meetings

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Storing meetings inside groups
** Pros: This design simplifies the source code by not requiring a separate class to store meetings.
** Cons: This design requires iterating through all groups to retreive the list of meetings

* **Alternative 2:** Storing meetings in a separate uniqueMeetingList class
** Pros: This design simplifies retreival of the list of meetings.
** Cons: This design causes the code becomes more complicated and more difficult to test.

===== Aspect: Specification of target group for meet and cancel commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Specifying the group using its name.
** Pros: This design makes the command syntax natural and intuitive.
** Cons: This design forces the user have to manually type in the group name.

* **Alternative 2:** Specifying the group using its index.
** Pros: This design is easier to use when the number of groups is high.
** Cons: This design causes the command syntax to become unnatural, and makes the program more suspectible to errors.
