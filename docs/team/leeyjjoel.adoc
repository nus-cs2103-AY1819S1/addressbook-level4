This portfolio outlines the contributions of Lee Yi Jie Joel to the following project(s).

== PROJECT: Anakin

---

This project was completed during August 2018 to November 2018 as part of a Software Engineering module (CS2103T) in
the National University of Singapore. The team comprises Tay Yu Jia, Joel Lee, Foo Guo Wei, David Goh and Nguyen
Trong Truong Thanh.

== Overview

Anakin is a desktop-based flashcard application which makes remembering things easy. The user
interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. Its key selling points are the ability to replace
traditional paper flashcards (thus saving the environment) and to provide an enhanced learning experience through the
well-established spaced repetition learning method.

It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

* *Main features*:
** Create decks of flashcards easily
** Review your flashcards on the go
** Track your performance for all flashcards
** Import and export decks

== Summary of contributions

This section acts as a summary of the contributions made by Lee Yi Jie Joel to project Anakin.

* *Major enhancement*: added *showDue* command as well as the scheduling algorithm behind it
** What it does: allows the users to see cards which have been scheduled on a particular date  .
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will want to be able to look through
 review cards based on how he has classified them
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. While in the review
mode, using the *supermemo2* spaced recognition algorithm, the student is saved from the hassle of seperating his/her flashcards
into boxes based on how well he/she remembers them. This will allow for a better studying experience and in turn better recall for tests

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Help command which allows user to seek help when he/she is lost or initially starting out
** Added systemtests to increase robustness of the application
** Implemented a `editdeck` command that allows user to update the details of their deck.
** Added an exit command to allow user to leave the deck
** Added a `select` command which is now deprecated
** Add `undo` and `redo` functions
