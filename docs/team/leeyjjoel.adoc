This portfolio outlines my contributions  to the following project.

== PROJECT: Anakin

---

Anakin is the result of our search for a better command line application to revise for exams. From August 2018 to November 2018,
Team T09-2 comprising of myself, Tay Yu Jia, Foo Guo Wei, David Goh, and Nguyen Truong Thanh built Anakin as part of a Software Engineering module (CS2103T) conducted at
the National University of Singapore.

== Overview

Anakin is a desktop-based flashcard application which makes remembering things easy. The user
interacts with the application primarily using a Command Line Interface. However, the user can fall back to the Java FX GUI if needed. Anakin uses https://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm[Super Memo 2]  which is the spaced repetition algorithm used by popular language learning tools such as
Duolingo, Wani Kani, and Memrise. +

Anakin aims to revolutionize the studying experience of the technically advanced user. On top of being easy to use,
Anakin is also environmentally friendly, having zero paper wastage, unlike conventional flashcards.

[NOTE]
====
What is spaced repetition? +
Spaced repetition is a learning technique that incorporates increasing intervals of time between subsequent review of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect.
====

It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.


* *Main features*:
** Create decks of flashcards easily
** Review your flashcards on the go
** Track your performance for all flashcards
** Import and export decks

== Summary of contributions

This section acts as a summary of my contributions to project Anakin.

* *Major enhancement*: I added autocompletion for commands
** What it does: Helps a user complete a partially typed command
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will want to be able to finish expressing
the command he wants to type with a simple press of <TAB>
** Highlights: This enhancement removes the need for the user to memorise long strings of command syntax. While typing in the command box, the user is saved from the hassle of checking the user guide
for commands he/she has forgotten. This will allow for a better user experience and in turn easier studying for tests.

* *Major enhancement*: I added the scheduling algorithm at the core of the product together with the `rank` command
** What it does: allows the users to sort cards by performance during review. Cards which the user has performed poorly on will be pushed to the top of the deck.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will want to review cards which he or she performed poorly on to increase the yield of her revision.
** Highlights: This allows user to focus on what's important to review and makes for more efficient study sessions.



* *Minor enhancements*:
** Added `help` command which allows user to seek help when he/she is lost.
** Implemented the `editdeck` command that allows users to update the name of their deck.
** Added the `exit` command to allow the user to leave the deck
** Added the `select` command which eventually formed the basis for other commands to be developed.
** Added `undo` and `redo` commands
