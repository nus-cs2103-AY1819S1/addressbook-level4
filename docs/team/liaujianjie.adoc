match clients (couples looking to have a wedding ceremony) to vendors (companies that offer services catered to
weddings).

*Some features include*:

* CLI interface and rich GUI interface
* Client and vendor database
* Detailed tabular breakdown of services listed
* Auto-matching of clients and vendors

== Summary of contributions

=== *Major enhancement*: Auto-matching
** *What it does:* Automatically finds vendors that can fulfill the service requirements of a specific client.
Inversely, it can also find all clients for which a specific vendor can serve.
** *Justification:* Manually searching for vendors for clients is extremely laborious and repetitive. This feature
reduces the search of vendors or clients to a single line of command.
** *Highlights:* Simple single one-line command: `client#123 automatch`
** *Contribution to functional code:* https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/88[#88], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/195[#195], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/199[#199], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/205[#205], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/222[#222], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/240[#240], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/274[#274], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/277[#277]
** *Contribution to tests:* https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/291[#291]

=== *Major enhancement*: Profile panel
** *What it does:* Renders the profile panel in an aesthetically appealing visual format.
** *Justification:* The previous static page was not very helpful and could not be customised to contain objects such as
arrays or maps.
** *Highlights:* Built with the blazing-fast GatsbyJS React Javascript framework for static websites.
** *Note:* The code for this portion resides in a https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/profile-site[separate
repository].

=== *Minor enhancement*: Contact type serialization
** *What it does:* Serializes the contact (both clients and vendors) as different types of entities in the same XML
file.
** *Justification:* Prior to this change, there was no mechanism to differentiate between clients and vendors when the
data was de-serialized from the XML file.
** *Highlights:* Serializes both client and vendor data into the same address book XML each type with a differentiable
format.
** *Contribution to functional code:* https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/143[#143]

=== *Other contributions*:
** Refactored `ServiceProvider` to `Vendor` (https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/239[#239])
** Ensure there is only one service name and cost when adding service (https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/273[#273])
** Made sure repository was up to date with the upstream branch (https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/79[#79])
** Minor readme updates (https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/35[#35], https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/49[#49])
** Took initiative to ensure that we had everything prioritized in the right order and ensure the team was focused
during our discussions.
** Spearheaded the various architecture design discussions.

== Contributions to the User Guide

|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting
end-users._
|===

=== Modifying the global structure of user guide

Since I was involved in the modelling of our application, I took charge in making the first wave of sweeping updates to our user guide. In doing so, I created a clear separation between _entity types_ (such as `client`) and _entity instances_ (like `client#123`).

Commands acting on a collection of a specific entity type were preceded by the name of the entity type whilst commands acting on a specific entity instance are preceded by a composition of the instance entity type and identifier.

Example documentation of a command that acts on an entity type:

====
*Listing and searching for contacts: `list`*

You can view all the contacts of a specific type in a list by specifying the contact type to be shown.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE> list`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client list`
|=====

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor list`
|=====
====

Example documentation of a command that acts on an entity instance:

====
*Deleting a contact: `delete`*

You can also `delete` a contact from *_Heart²_*, by specifying its unique ID.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE>#<ID> delete`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client#123 delete`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor#123 delete`
|=====

[TIP]
You can `undo` and `redo` deleting a contact!

=== Documentation for auto-matching

I wrote the entire instructions for using one of the most critial feature of our application--auto-matching.

====
*Automatching for a client: `automatch`*

You can easily find vendors that can fulfil the request services with this command.

Format: `client#<ID> automatch`

[NOTE]
It only shows you the vendors within the budget requirement that fulfils a particular service requirement of the client.

=== Experimenting with icons

Additionally, I have experimented with coloured icons for notes, tips and warnings to provide a consistent visual format when additional content is appended. We eventually decided to remove it because of formatting issues with AsciiDoctor.

I have also made some minor tweaks to make the user guide squeaky clean.

=== Document design decisions for auto-matching

I documented the design decisions behind auto-matching and created a custom graphic to assist in the explanation. Below is an excerpt from the developer guide:

====
*Finding matches between clients and service providers*

The application boasts auto-matching features that reduces the (once-laborious) task of matching service providers a single command.

*High level design*

.High level overview of how auto-matching works
image::auto-matching.png[width:"800"]

1. On invocation, the auto-matching algorithm functionally maps all service requirements from a Client into predicates for performing the first step of filtering the Service Providers.
2. The service providers are then sorted by a fair ranking algorithm to ensure even distribution of jobs between Service Providers.
