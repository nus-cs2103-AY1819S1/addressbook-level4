== PROJECT: OASIS

---

== Overview

https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-1/main[OASIS] is an employee management application that brings your office together. It is an all-in-one tool for office administration and communication that runs on any computer. With the use of primarily textual commands coupled with a beautiful user interface, you can get your administrative jobs done faster than with traditional point-and-click applications. Some of the main features that you can look forward to using are employee records management, authentication and permissions, assignment management, and leave management.

This portfolio serves as a summary to showcase my contribution for https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-1/main[OASIS].

== Summary of contributions

The following section shows my various contributions for OASIS.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=kokjianyu&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-11&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Link to RepoSense]]

* *Major Enhancement*: Added *Permission System* to *control what commands each employee can use* in OASIS

** What it does:
*** Ensures that commands are executed only by employees with the permission required for it. It also allow users with the required permission(`ASSIGN_PERMISSION` permission), to view and modify the permissions other employees have.
** Justification:
*** There are many commands in OASIS that should only be performed by employees with certain
authorization. Usage of permission allows the admins to easily ensure that previously stated criteria is met by assigning permissions only to authorized employees.
** Highlights:
*** This enhancement requires modification to different components of the application, Model, Storage and Logic.
Therefore, implementation was challenging as it requires in-depth knowledge of the different components.
*** This feature is coded to be simple to use and extensible. New permissions can be added simply into `Permission` enum class, and any new Command class only need to 1 line of code to ensure that it can only be executed by authorized employees.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Added *Command Auto-Complete* feature
** What it does:
*** When user type in the command box, OASIS will predict what commands the user is going to run, and display a drop down list containing all suggestions.
** Justification:
*** Users might find it hard to memorize commands in OASIS. Having this enhancement will make it easier for them to find the commands they want to execute.
