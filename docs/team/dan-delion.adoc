== PROJECT: Lost and Found

== Overview

Lost and Found is a desktop application used for managing lost and found articles.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: revamp of GUI
** What it does: change what was previously the browser panel to show the details of a selected article.
** Justification: this allows the user to view further information about the selected article, including the finder and claimer of an article.

* *Minor enhancement*: remove support for browser panel
** What it does: remove every trace of browser panel from the already tightly-coupled source code.
