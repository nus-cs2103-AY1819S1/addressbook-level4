== PROJECT: ThanePark

== Overview

The purpose of this portfolio is to document my contributions to the software engineering module(CS2103T) project,
ThanePark.

ThanePark is a desktop application for theme park management. The application is optimized for keyboard-oriented users
and retains user-friendly graphics that informs users of their decisions in a glance.
Theme park operators can interact with it by using a Command Line Interface(CLI). It also has a Graphical User Interface
(GUI) created with JavaFX.
ThanePark is mostly written in Java and has about ten thousands of code.

My part in the project is to implement `open` and `shutdown` commands so that operators can open and close the rides
easily.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to open and shutdown rides in ThanePark*
** It allows the user to open and shutdown rides easily.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can open/shutdown rides with a single
   command.
** Highlights: This enhancement introduces a new enum class, `Status`. It allows the user to know whether the rides are
   in `open`, `shutdown`, or `maintenance` status.
** Credits: The `open` and `shutdown` features are based on the way `update` feature works, with the help of
   `UpdateRideDescriptor`.

* *Minor enhancement*: Refactor `add`, `delete` and `update` commands.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=leongengsea[Functional
   code and test code]]

* *Other contributions*:

** Documentation:
*** Update the user guide for the `open` and `shutdown` features.
*** Update the developer guide for the implementation of the `open` feature with sequence and activity diagrams of how
the `open` command works.
*** Update project portfolio page(PPP).
