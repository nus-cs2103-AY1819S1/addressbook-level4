== Overview
This portfolio documents my contributions towards the project I have undertaken in the course **CS2103T - Software
Engineering**. It aims to demonstrate the theoretical and practical knowledge I have gained in the field of Software
Engineering over the semester.

== PROJECT: MeNUS
*MeNUS* is an integrated restaurant management desktop application designed for restaurant owners. It comprises five
sub-management systems - 1) Menu, 2) Inventory, 3) Sales, 4) Reservation and 5) Authentication, each of which plays an
indispensable role in ensuring the success of a restaurant business. They were meticulously developed to streamline
the process of tracking dishes, ingredients, bookings and sales records while upholding a substantial level of security.

*MeNUS* provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for restaurant owners to interact with and is complemented with a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is constructed with https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/overview/jfxpub-overview.htm[JavaFX].
MeNUS is written in https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html[Java 9]
with approximately 25 kLOC.

 2) conduct product and implementation design to meet end-users' requirements; +
 3) write high quality code that is error-free, comprehensible, and reusable; +
 4) write effective and efficient test codes to ensure high quality assurance; +
 5) use various modelling and version control tools; +
 6) collaborate with other developers.

* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=hyperionnkj[RepoSense]
* *Major enhancement*: Developed and integrated a **Sales Management System (SMS)** into MeNUS to help restaurant owners
keep track of financial records, analyse their financial performance and devise marketing strategies.
** *What it does*: SMS allows owners to add, modify and remove sales records. An **Auto-ingredient update** mechanism
is incorporated to enable automatic consumption of ingredients whenever a record is added. Also provides owners
with analytical features to generate sales report, plot sales chart and rank dates/items according to
profitability.

** *Justification*: These features provide efficiency and effectiveness in keeping track of huge amount of financial
records every day which can be extremely tedious if done via the conventional means of pen and paper. The
`Auto-ingredient update mechanism` also saves restaurant managers the trouble of frequent inventory tracking which
often takes up a significant amount of time and effort. Analytical features assists restaurant owners in making
strategic marketing decisions, projecting business's revenue as well as monitoring its long-term growth. These ensure
 the financial success of the restaurant in the long run.

** *Highlights*: This enhancement adds on to the limited number of key management aspects MeNUS can provide. It
requires an in-depth analysis of design alternatives as well as a thorough understanding of the entire code
architecture. The implementation was challenging as the `Auto-ingredient update mechanism` required the integration of
the Menus, Ingredients and Sales management system. An extensive knowledge of how each management works was therefore
essential. Analytical features also required substantial knowledge of front-end programming languages such as
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp[CSS] and https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp[XML].
