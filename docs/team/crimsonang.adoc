PROJECT: Student Schedule Planner

---

== Overview

This portfolio showcases the software engineering skills I acquired during my time of study in National University of
 Singapore (NUS).

*Student Schedule Planner* (SSP) is a desktop application created by my team T12-3 for CS2103T module. SSP
aimed to aid university students to manage their tasks effectively. It is morphed from an existing product called
*Address Book (Level 4)*, with constraints such as command-line interface must be the main mode of user input.

My contributions to the project included adding *task monitoring system* which consists of `firstday`,
`listday` and `listweek` commands to aid the users in better monitoring of their tasks.

== Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *task monitoring system*
** What it does: This feature allows user to know what is the current academic week whenever they launch the
application within the academic semester. It also allow users to know what tasks they have that are due on the current
date or from the current date until the closest Sunday.
** Justification: This feature allows user to monitor their tasks easier as they may know that they have certain tasks
 due on a particular week and could use this to plan their remaining time properly. Users could also easily know what
  tasks they have on the current week.
** Highlights: This implementation was challenging as it required creating a new `model` and `storage` for saving and
retrieving the data. It was also tedious and time consuming to conduct both system and manual tests for different
dates due to the need to manipulate my device's system date.
