== PROJECT: LearnVocabulary

---

== Overview

LearnVocabulary is a desktop application for people who prefer to use an offline version of the dictionary for learning purposes.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the learn feature command
** What it does: Searches for the given word on LearnVocabulary and extracts the definition of the word. It then attaches a default tag, which is all stored inside LearnVocabulary.
** Justification: This feature is the backbone of LearnVocabulary because it saves the user a lot of time by querying and storing the word with its meaning. It then saves all of that into a personalized storage area for the user to review (display and show) at a later time.
** Highlights: This enhancement had to be properly integrated by carefully navigating around the different existing commands.

* *Minor enhancements*: Added the show command, which displays the filtered word(s) unto the Ui, making the Ui appear more engaging and interactive.
