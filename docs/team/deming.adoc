== PROJECT: ModsUni

== 1. Overview

modsUni is a desktop timetable management application created by students for students. It incorporates a simple GUI with majority of its user interactions occurring in its in-built CLI.

== 2. About this portfolio
This project portfolio documents my contributions to the ModsUni project.
It includes a summary of features that I implemented and other contributions to the project.

== 3. Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: This enhancement added functionality to **manage modules in the database.**
** What it does: The add module feature adds a non-existing module to the database. Conversely, the remove module feature
removes a existing module from the database. In addition, the edit module feature allows modification of the information
of existing modules.

** Justification: When there is a change in module information, introduction of new modules or removal of modules, the
database should match the changes. The administrator will then have to do modify the database to keep it up to date. The
`addModuleDB`, `removeModuleDB` and `editModule` command allows the administrator to perform such tasks.

** Highlights: This enhancement is an end-to-end feature and makes use of almost all components of the software. Though
the implementation of these features is intuitive and makes use of existing code wherever possible, it was challenging
as it required the creation of a PrereqGenerator class (to handle parsing) from scratch.

** Relevant pull requests: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-2/main/pull/92[#92],
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-2/main/pull/123[#123] and https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W17-2/main/pull/186[#186]

* *Minor enhancement*: This enhancement added support for multiple administrator accounts.
** What it does: This enhancement allows logged in admin users to create new admin accounts. Similarly, they can choose to
remove other admin users as well.

** Justification: Since the database have a large number of modules, administrator may find it difficult to manage the
entire database by alone. Having the ability to assign new administrators to help spread the workload makes it much easier
to manage the database.

** Highlights: This enhancement is an end-to-end feature and makes use of almost all components of the software, from
`Storage` to `Ui`. It was challenging as the feature had to handle validation of different data types, to ensure that
the feature functions sensibly.
