---

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: enhanced *FindCommand* to make it support fuzzy matching
** What it does: allows the user to find Person by name and supports fuzzy matching, which means even if the user has a small typo, it can still find Persons with similar names.
** Justification: This feature enhancement makes this command more practical because sometimes users may type wrongly during searching. However, fuzzy matching allows small mistakes in typing and makes searching much easier.
** Highlights: This search allows fuzzy matching (with Levenshtein Distance < 3) only when the length of the keyword is greater than 3. If the length of the keyword you type in is smaller or equal to 3, the keyword must be exactly the same to expected

* *Major enhancement*: extended FindCommand to *FindAddressCommandï¼Œ FindEmailCommand, and FindPhoneCommand*
** What it does: allows the user to find Persons by address, email, and phone number and support fuzzy matching, which means even if the user has a small typo, it can still find Persons with similar address, email, or phone number.
** Justification: These features largely improve the convenience for finding a specific Person or a list of Persons. For instance, a Person now can be found by his or her address, email or phone number, and multiple step of find command can be used to find a person by more than one kind of conditions.
** Highlights: All these commands are case insensitive and support fuzzy matching (however, with some restrictions, which are specified in User Guide).

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Built tests case for *Find* related commands and UI.
