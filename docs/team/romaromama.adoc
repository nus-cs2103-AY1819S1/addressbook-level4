== PROJECT: ModulePlanner

== Overview

This is a project portfolio about a team project called ModulePlanner which I took part in.

ModulePlanner is a desktop application currently designed for Computer Science students of National University of Singapore
to help them plan for their modules.

The main interface used to interact with the app is through the Command Line Interface (CLI), but the result of
the interactions are presented in the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Role

* Developer

== Summary of contributions
=== Major Enhancements
* Implemented the `add` command
** What it does: Allows the user to add modules to the planner after passing several checkings
*** These checkings are based from realistic limitations implemented on taking modules in NUS
** Justification: Prevents the user to have an invalid study plan
** Highlight: It takes realistic considerations such as not allowing to take 2 equivalent modules on the same semester
and not allowing to add modules which prerequisites has not been fulfilled.

=== Minor Enhancement
* Added UI for displaying `status` command result
* Implemented `status` command
** What it does: Allows the user to keep track of their progress in the planner
** Justification: Prevents the user to take unnecessary modules
** Hightlight: Takes into account the focus area of the user
