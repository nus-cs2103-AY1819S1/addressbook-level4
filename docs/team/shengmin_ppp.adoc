== PROJECT: WishBook
By: `CS2103T Team T16-1`
---

== Overview

WishBook (WB) is a piggy bank in a digital app form, made for people who need a user-friendly solution for keeping track of their disposable income. Not only does WB keep records of your savings, it also allows users to set items as goals for users to work towards, serving as a way to cultivate the habit of saving. WB is made for people who have material wants in life, but are uncertain of purchasing said wants, by helping them to reserve disposable income so that they know they can spend on their wants.

This project portfolio consists of the contributions I have made to WishBook over the semester.

== Summary of contributions

=== *Major enhancement*: added the ability to view savings history

****
Below is a screenshot of the savings history for a `Wish`

* What it does: Shows a history of savings you have allocated for any particular wish in the wishbook, from newest to oldest.
* Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the automatic book-keeping of savings for each Wish allows the user to easily and clearly keep track of his or her savings over a length of time.
+
This feature also allows for extensions since the data collected in terms of amount saved as well as frequency of saving allows for precious insights to be drawn about the saving habits as well as saving priorities of the user.
* Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
+
The implementation of this feature involves many different components and is intrinsically tied to the state of the `WishBook`, which changes when the user executes an action-based command such as the `Add`, `Save`, `Edit` command.

====
Areas involved:

* Persistent Storage
** Facilitate reading and writing of savings histories of all wishes to hard disk. This data will also be saved to the hard disk when triggered by a change in the state of the wishbook.

* Dynamic updating of savings history
** In order for savings histories of each `Wish` to be updated dynamically, the implementation follows an event-driven model. When an action-based command is executed, subscribed classes will be notified of the change in state of the `WishBook`.
** The implementation of tracking the savings history of each `Wish` also needs to follow a `VersionedModel` that responds when notified by the change in `WishBook` state.
* Testing
** Unit and Integrated testing for the code contributed.
====

* Credits:
** Persistent storage
*** Savings history saved as `xml` format using the `JAXB` framework.
** Dynamic updating of savings history
*** Follows event-driven model of `AddressBook-L4`
*** `VersionedModel` implementation inspired by `undo`, `redo` functionality in `AddressBook-L4`.
** Testing
*** `JUnit` testing framework adopted.

=== *Minor enhancement*: updated the  `Help Window` display.
The `Help Window` is a pop-up window that appears when the `Help` command is executed. It is a guide to aid the user navigate the `WishBook`.
****
The image below shows a screenshot of the `Help Window`.
