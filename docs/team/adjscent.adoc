---

== Overview

[https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W10-3/main[EventOrganiser]] is a desktop event organiser application used to store personal particulars and organise events and for other users to join the event as event participants.The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

This project portfolio summarizes the contributions that I have done to EventOrganiser.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to manage schedule*
** What it does: Allows the user to manage their schedule inside EventOrganiser. Allows the user to compare multiple schedules to get the possible free slots. User can use NusMods to populate his schedule. 
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is able to find out the vacant time slots of every person, so that he can plan the event time with more considerations.
** Highlights: It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. There is a need to choose a tradeoff between ease of management vs schedule detail or else the performance of the event organiser will suffer. The integration of NusMods was challenging as it requires the reading of documentation and analysing how nusmods handles valid and invalid api requests.
