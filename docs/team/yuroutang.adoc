== PROJECT: Car Park Finder

---

My name is Tang Yurou, a Year 2 Computer Science student at NUS School of Computing.
This is the portfolio of the project my team and I worked on for CS2103T
Software Engineering module. Other than implementing various enhancement
features, my main responsibilities include ensuring proper documentation
and ensuring proper integration of command features implemented by different
teammates. My teammates include Keith Fong, Yeo Zhuan Yu and Xiao Delong.

== Overview

The project that my team and I worked on is a
Car Park Finder that helps users find a suitable car park easily.
Car Park Finder is a desktop application customised for users who
are more comfortable with typing.
The application uses the Command Line Interface for all commands, i.e.
all functions of the application can be used by simply typing!

=== More About Our Application

The `Find` command helps you find a list of car parks within a specific
location. After which, you can use the `Filter` command
to narrow down the list of car parks to just those that fit your needs,
e.g. you can use the `Filter` command to find a car park that
has both night parking and short-term parking. With our `Query` and `Notify`
feature, you can always received the most updated car park information!

Moreover, to decide on which car park to choose or whether to even drive,
you can use the `Calculate` command to calculate the cost of
parking at a particular car park during
a specified period of time.

The `Autocomplete` and `Abbreviation` features makes it even easier for
you to find a car park of your choice by making typing easier.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_Given below is a summary of my contributions to the project. My main contributions
 include implementing the `Filter` command and `Calculate` command._
|===

* *Major enhancement*: added the *Filter command*
** What it does: allow users to filter car parks listed by `Find` command based on six criteria:
*** Car park has available parking slots
*** Car park has short-term parking
*** Type of car park
*** Car park has free parking between a specified time period
*** Car park has night parking
*** Type of parking system that the car park uses
** Justification: The feature helps to narrow down a long
list of car parks in the location to just those that meets the
criteria of the user. Helps user to decide on which car park to go to.

** Highlights:
*** `Filter` command integrates with `Find` command to accomplish location-based
filtering.
*** Moreover, the command can work with varying number of flags, i.e.
users can choose how many criteria they would like to filter by, and input them in any order.
Each criteria may have different input parameters.
*** If users were to forget what flags are available for use and which parameters are required
for each flag, error messages would guide them to execute the commands correctly.
 +

* *Minor enhancement*: added the *Calculate command*
** What it does: Allow users to calculate the cost of parking at
a car park when they specify the day and time they are parking.
** Justification: Users might want to know how much it cost to park their car, or choose between driving and
other transport options e.g. taking public transport.
