== Overview

This portfolio highlights my *key contributions* in project ThanePark.
ThanePark is a *theme park management* application primarily designed for theme park operators,
with the ability to manage and find essential theme park ride information at a glance. +

This project was done as part of NUS CS2103 module requirement on 2018, to practice and showcase my ability
to develop a *Java application* as *a team of 4* undergraduate students taking the module. This project had a
*constraint of developing a Command Line Interface (CLI)*. In the course of this project, my team
extended an existing AddressBook application to build this theme park management application.

== Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Developed features that assists users in managing commands of the ThanePark application to *improve user productivity*.
** *What it does*: It facilitates finding help on specific commands, assist users in completing commands,
provide a mechanism to log and retrieve command history and gives users important information at a glance.
** *Justification*: The primary role of theme park operators is to manage the ride they are stationed at.
By making the application easier to use, operators will not find using the application a chore, can quickly
perform required actions and focus on managing their ride.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement affects existing commands and can be easily extended on addition of new commands. There
is an added challenge of reducing dependencies across the `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage` and `UI` components of ThanePark.
** *Credits*: https://github.com/tipsy/j2html[j2html] library to aid formatting of HTML reports.
