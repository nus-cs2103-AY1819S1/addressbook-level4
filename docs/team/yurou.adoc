== PROJECT: Car Park Finder

---

== Overview

The Car Park Finder is an application to find a HDB (Housing Development Board) car
park that is suited to your needs as easily as possible. The application uses a
Command Line Interface (CLI), hence you could find the car park you need with the
convenience of simply typing. If you use the computer frequently and commute by
driving, this application is for you!

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1*: added the *Filter command*
** What it does: allow users to filter car parks at a certain location based on six criteria:
*** Car park has available parking slots
*** Car park has short-term parking
*** Type of car park
*** Car park has free parking between a specified time period
*** Car park has night parking
*** Type of parking system that the car park uses
** Justification: This feature would be really helpful to users because it
would be too time consuming for users to scroll through every car park in the
location to find a suitable car park. The feature helps to narrow down a long
list of car parks in the location to just those that meets the criteria of the user

** Highlights:
*** Filter command needs to integrate with Find command to accomplish location-based
filtering.
*** Moreover, the command also needs to work with varying number of flags, i.e.
users can choose how many criteria they would like to filter by, and input them in any order.
Each criteria may also have different input parameters.
*** If users were to forget what flags there are and what parameters are required
for each flag, error messages would guide them to execute the commands correctly.

* *Major enhancement 2*: added the *Calculate command*
** What it does: Allow users to calculate the cost of parking at a car park.
** Justification: Users might want to know how much it cost to park their car, and choose between using their car and
other transport options e.g. taking public transport.

* *Minor enhancement*: Revised the list of command messages to suite the needs of the commands better.
