== PROJECT: Deadline Manager

This portfolio summarizes what I have contributed in a Software Engineering team project in CS2103T.
Within 6 weeks, our team of 5 students has transformed an existing code base (about 10 kLOC)
into a new application called Deadline Manager.

== Overview

Deadline Manager is a Java application to help users manage deadlines.
Besides basic features like add/edit/remove tasks and import/export task lists,
Deadline Manager supports recurring tasks, complex filtering, flexible sorting, tags, and attachments.

== Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *ability to manage recurring tasks in Deadline Manager*
** What it does: It allows users to add and complete recurring tasks in Deadline Manager.
Users can use the `add` command with the frequency parameter (in days) to add a recurring task.
To complete a task, users can use the `complete` command.
Completing a non-recurring task will delete the task.
Completing a recurring task will shift the deadline of the task to the next occurrence.
** Justification: This feature allows users to manage recurring tasks, which are very common.
The `complete` command provides a natural way for users to mark a task as completed.
** Highlights: Implementing this feature requires modifying the `Task` class, the most basic class in the code base.
A minor change in this class may take 4-5 hours of modifying parts of code which are dependent on `Task`.

* *Minor enhancement*: added `priority`, `frequency` and removed unnecessary fields in the `Task` class
 ** Highlights: Changes in the `Task` class take a lot of time because it is used at a lot of places in the code base.
