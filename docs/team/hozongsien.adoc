== PROJECT: 3VIA

---

== Overview

The purpose of this portfolio is to document my role and contributions to project 3VIA.
3VIA is a desktop flash card application designed for self-driven learners to reinforce their knowledge.
The main form of interaction with the application is via the keyboard.
3 notable features are learning, testing and reviewing. This is a team-based project.
My main task was to implement a mass import feature.
Additionally, my assigned role was to review the code quality written by each member which is done by reviewing each memberâ€™s pull request on Github.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *import multiple cards*.
** What it does: allows the user to add multiple cards into 3VIA at one go.
** Justification: This feature incentivizes non-existing users to use 3VIA more as the users can import their existing digital notes quickly.
** Highlight: This enhancement allows grouping of multiple pairs of questions and answers under a set of topics. Thereby reducing the need to repeatedly tag each question and answer pair with the same set of topics.
