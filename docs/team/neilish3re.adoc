== Overview

Concierge(TM) is a desktop hotel management application for receptionists to
handle potential bookings and current guests. The user interacts with it
using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and
has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=neilish3re[Code Contributed]]

* *Major enhancements*:
** *Implemented Autocomplete Feature*

*** What it does: Ihe Autocomplete feature allows the user to seamlessly type
in user commands with the autocompletion of an incomplete command that is
input by the user. This feature helps the user by prompting the correct
format.

*** Justification: This feature is not mandatory to have, however it would
save the user a lot of time, especially if he/she is dealing with many
different commands (in our case, many guests waiting to check in at the same
time).

*** Highlights: It also eliminates the need for the user to remember all
the prefixes because my implementation not only fills in the command, but fills in
subsequent prefixes for the user as well which makes the feature more effective
and efficient.

*** Credits: [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T09-4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#autocomplete-feature[Idea]]
Got the idea of implementing the autocomplete feature replete with prefixes
and the various parameters pre-filled in from the link given. However, I decided
to implement it with a Control button press so as to minimise the user having
to navigate back and forth in the Command Box and it will also make for quicker
typing once the user gets a flow of the autocomplete feature.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** *Implemented Command Archive feature* (Shifted to v2.0)

*** What it does: This feature keeps an archive of all the commands (both
valid and invalid) input by a user and adds a time stamp plus user tag. This is
different from the history command because this information will be exported
into a txt/xml file instead of being destroyed at the end of the session as
is seen in AB4

*** Justification: This feature is not mandatory, however it would serve an
important purpose to hotel managers or the person-in-charge. This feature is
aimed at tracking and identifying any suspicious activity and also to serve
as data that could either be used in the future for monthly audits and even
possibly generating statistics as to what items/facilities are patronised
most by the guests.
