== PROJECT: Piconso

---

== Overview

Piconso is an CLI-based (Command Line Interface) image editor designed and developed for quick and efficient image-editing.
Many of today's top image editing softwares are often overloaded with features, and for those who just want to perform and learn basic image editing, the learning curve of these softwares is way too steep.

Sporting a simplified CLI interface, it is easy to navigate and interact with Piconso through basic text commands. The product caters especially towards individuals familiar with CLI but at the same time, aims to be easy for new users such as photographers to pick up.

The application is Java-based and well documented, with its code quality ensured via a series of manual and unit tests. The following will detail more about my contributions to the development of Piconso.

== Summary of contributions

=== *Main enhancement*: Enabled connectivity to Google Photos

Google Photos has become a popular platform that is used by many to safely store and share their images. As such, allowing connectivity to Google allows users to quickly retrieve their stored images on Google Photos for offline editing without having to leave Piconso.

This enhancement provides users with the ability to:

* Traverse Google Photos and filter images by album
* Download an image or an entire album
* Upload an image or an entire folder

With this feature, the user can instantly download, edit and upload his edited photo for safe storage and quick sharing to other users. This especially adds value to users such as photographers or developers, who may have a large batch of images stored on the cloud that they would like to edit.

* _Highlights_: This enhancement runs authentication asynchronously such that if a login request is not followed through, it leaves the main application unaffected. Additionally, the upload, download and list features all have multiple command variants for user convenience.
* _Credit_: Google Photos Java Client API and Google OAuth API have been used throughout Google related commands. Certain parts of the aspect that allows login to Google Photos was also based upon the https://github.com/google/java-photoslibrary/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/com/google/photos/library/sample/demos/AlbumDemo.java[example found here]


=== *Minor enhancements*:
*Implemented a ls command*

Similar to `ls` used in consoles, the ls command I implemented allows users to view the content of the directory they are currently in. However, the `ls` implemented in this project only lists folders and images so as to prevent user confusion.

*Created the initial User Interface (UI)  and logic for HistoryListPanel*

The HistoryListPanel (as seen on the upper left of the application) provides a way for users to keep track of the transformations they have performed thus far on the layer in a visual form.
The logic previously handled only transformations on one layer, but was later changed by the team after the implementation of layers to incorporate it.

* _Highlights_: The list currently constantly highlights the last performed transformation, and selection on the panel has been disabled to prevent user confusion.

*Created UI and logic for Film Reel*

We came to a decision that viewing all images at once would be too confusing for the user, and thus we decided to show the image by _batches_
such that a user can only view 10 images at once, and navigate via `next` and `preview` commands.

The FilmReel (as seen on the lower left of the application) shows the currently viewed batch of images in the directory.  It provides an easy way for users to preview their images and know the image index associated with it.
