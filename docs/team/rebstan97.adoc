== PROJECT: MeNUS
This project portfolio documents my contributions towards *MeNUS* for the module CS2103T Software Engineering.

== Overview

*MeNUS* is an all-in-one restaurant management desktop application. It is designed for restaurant managers to manage
 their menus, ingredients, sales and reservations conveniently and effectively - all in one place. It provides a
 Command Line Interface (CLI) for restaurant managers to interact with, and has a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 created with JavaFX. It is written with approximately 30 kLOC.

== Summary of Contributions
Below are my contributions in terms of feature enhancements, project management and documentation:

* *Major enhancement*: Added *commands to keep track of the ingredient availability of a restuarant*
** *What it does*:
*** The `add-ingredient`, `delete-ingredient`, `edit-ingredient` and `list-ingredients` commands allow
the user to maintain a list of ingredients used by the restaurant.
*** The `low-stock` and `stockup` commands enable the
user to know which ingredients require stocking up and update the ingredient count as necessary.
*** The `select-ingredient` command lets the user view the details of each ingredient.

** *Justification*:
*** Provide convenience: Restaurants use a large variety of ingredients daily, making it difficult to quickly
determine the availability of each ingredient. This feature reduces the need for restaurant managers
 to manually do stock taking of its restaurant's ingredients.
*** Reduce food wastage: Restaurants often stock up in fixed quantities of ingredients, regardless of the actual
availability in the pantry. This leads to food wastage, if excess ingredients are not used. This feature provides
restaurant owners with more information about availability, so that they only stock up what is necessary.

** *Highlights*: This enhancement involves adding several new commands to *MeNUS*. It requires understanding of the
underlying architecture and the components `logic`, `storage` and `model`. To maintain good abstraction, it
 is also necessary to implement appropriate model interfaces so as to integrate the ingredient feature with other
 features eg menu and sales management.
