== PROJECT: LearnVocabulary

---

== Overview

LearnVocuabulary is a desktop application for people who prefer to use an offline version of the dictionary for learning purposes.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the trivia and trivia answer commands
** What it does: Allows the user to start a trivia of 10 questions based on his/her vocabulary list. Finishing the 10 questions will show the user how well he/she has done in the trivia.
** Justification: This feature allows the user to practice what they have learnt using LearnVocabulary and engages in active learning for the user. It also helps the user in remembering new words as well as provides the user an indication of how well they are doing.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the meaning class and updated the word class to accept the meaning attribute.
