Hello! I am John Phua, a Year 2 Computer Science undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore.
Over the semester, my team and I built _Cow_, a project management application.
This portfolio will introduce you to _Cow_ and my contributions towards its development.

= PROJECT: Cow
== Overview

Cow is a desktop task manager with project management capabilities, powered by a command-line interface.
It is written in Java by a team of 5 undergraduates from the NUS School of Computing.

By entering commands, Cow allows you to efficiently:

* Manage a list of tasks
* Manage a list of group members across different project groups
* Assign tasks to people
* View the monthly workload of people through a calendar view

== Summary of contributions

* *Major feature*: Searching of tasks by name, date and tags
** Purpose: Allowing you to efficiently search for tasks
** Value to project: Task lists can get long and cluttered,
this feature allows you to easily filter through your long list of tasks and retrieve what you want.
** Highlights: This feature was built to be flexible according to your needs. You can combine different
search criteria to make your search more specific. This required the design of a new class that can accept and
compound different search criteria together.
