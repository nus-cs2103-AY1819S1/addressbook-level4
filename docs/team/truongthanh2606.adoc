== PROJECT: Anakin

---

== Overview
Anakin is a desktop flashcard management application created by team T09-2 to solve the inherent problems associated with physical flashcards. It aims to facilitate quick and intuitive management of virtual flashcards as well as the sharing of flashcard decks. Additionally, it features the ability to rate the difficulty of individual flashcards and a scheduling algorithm that prompts reviews of cards based on their difficulty rating.

Team T09-2 consisted of myself, Joel Lee, Tay Yu Jia, Foo Guo Wei, and David Goh.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed:* https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=truongthanh2606[GitHub]

* *Major enhancement: Re-design model component*

 ** What can the new model do:

 *** Allows Anakin to have a list of decks, each deck contains a card list with questions and answers.
 *** Allows UI to observe both the deck list and card list so that it can update its deck panel and
 card panel when these lists are modified (executing commands).
 *** Allows Logic component to execute its set of commands by providing a Model interface,
 which can support the logic of those operations.

 ** Justification:
 The new model component determines how objects like deck and card interacts with each other and
  manipulate the state of the application.


* *Other enhancements:*

** *Implement `sort` command*

*** What can it do:
**** Sort the current deck list in lexicographical order.
**** Sort the current card list in lexicographical order if user is inside a deck.

*** Justification: This allows user to manage their data better and to find
 deck or card easily.

** *Implement `find` command*

*** What can it do:
**** Search for decks by name if user is under the home directory.
**** Search for cards by question if user is inside a deck.
**** Search for partial word (keyword need not be exactly the same as the deck's name or card's question)

*** Justification: This allows user to locate the deck or card that contains specific keywords
 quickly.

** *Add messages to `undo` and `redo` commands*

*** What is the new messages: The `undo` and `redo` messages will show which command has
just been `undo`, or `redo`.
*** Justification: This provides user more transparent view of the commands being executed.
