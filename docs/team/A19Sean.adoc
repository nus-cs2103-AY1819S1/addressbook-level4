'Ren' in Mandarin translates to 'person' or 'people', and true to our name, this app is all about managing oneâ€™s network of clients in an organized, efficient and intuitive manner. InsuRen is geared to the needs of the modern Insurance salesman, but anyone whose business is their strong rapport with their clients will find this to be an indispensable tool.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to view tagged contacts and to edit and delete tags*
** What it does: allows the user view all contacts with user-specified tags, as well as edit and delete tags across all contacts.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can easily view relevant contacts and organise their contact book.
** Highlights: This enhancement makes use of a new `PersonContainsTagPredicate` to find the relevant tagged contacts. The enhancement also has three different functionality within one command word by recognising other keywords present in the user's command.
