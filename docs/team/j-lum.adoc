== Project: Piconso

== Overview

Piconso is a powerful general-purpose image editing tool.
The user interacts with it through a flexible command-line interface and receives instant visual feedback through the Graphical User Interface (GUI) written in JavaFX.
The application is mainly written in Java and spans a considerable 10k Lines of Code (LoC).
The codebase is well-maintained with a rigorous system of checks and tests in place to ensure that code quality is consistently high.
A comprehensive set of guides are also provided to ensure a smooth on-boarding process for both users and contributors alike.

== Summary of contributions
As the point man of the group, I led the group through discussions from idea generation to delegation of work.
I placed extra emphasis on engineering optimal solutions to real pain points.
As a result, my team was able to morph the given codebase from a trivial application into a polished product.

I put my considerable experience to use by being available at all times to help out with various tasks like design considerations and debugging. I believe that my contribution has improved the unlying engineering of the codebase which in turn sped up the application manyfold.

My major contributions are as follows:

**Designed and implemented the unlying data structures and models for the manipulation of canvases and layers.**

This allowed other team members to maintain a clear separation of concerns and reduce dependencies which in turn made the code base less prone to breaking changes. This is a major change that affects virtually all of the code base and future developers looking to add or improve Piconso will have to build upon my models.

In fact, I have already extended my models to provide end-users with a hassle-free and easily understandable way to navigate more intricate image editing features such as layer ordering and canvas size. This improves the user experience significantly as these features are expected of any modern image editing tool. It also reduces the friction of users migrating to Piconso from other competitors.


**Added a sub-command targeted at tech-savvy users : `raw`.**

In line with our goal of being a powerful and flexible tool, I have added a feature that allows users to tap into the full power of Piconso. This is a notable departure from the other commands in the application which can be fairly restrictive but easy to learn. The raw command allows users to quickly experiment and iterate upon their image editing process without excessive hand-holding from the application.

By giving advanced users the freedom to do as they please, I have brought Piconso closer in terms of feature parity as compared to commercial heavy-weights like Photoshop.

Developers will also save time on manually implementing obscure functionalities that the majority of the end-users will likely never use. This results in a more streamlined code base unlike Photoshop which clocks in at over 10 million LoCs.

Besides that, I have also made multiple smaller contributions which significantly improves the user experience.

**Implemented the ImagePanel**

The ImagePanel is at the heart of Piconso, displaying the output of Piconso to the user visually. It was carefully engineered with reuse in mind and its usage painstakingly documented for future developers.

**Improved upon the HistoryListPanel**

Building upon the work of other teammates, I have improved the HistoryListPanel to reflect past operations on across multiple layers. Now users can quickly see what operations they have performed on each layer.

**Implemented the LayerPanel**

Similar to the HistoryListPanel, the LayerPanel displays information that that users might have trouble keeping track of in a clean and easily grokkable fashion. Users can clearly see which layer they are operating on as well as the order of layers.

**Executed upon the change in layout**

I rearranged the layout of the user interface components from the initial code base to one that was designed by the team to be more user-friendly.

Here is the code that I have written for this product: [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T09-3/main/commits?author=j-lum[All commits]] [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=j-lum[Dashboard]]

**Other contributions**

** Project management:

I commented on critical pull requests.
I also extensively tested and reported bugs along with a comprehensive reproduction reports: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W14-4/main/issues/170[#170] https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W14-4/main/issues/175[#175]

** Documentation:

I wrote a tutorial to walk users through the on-boarding process with a sample project that demonstrates most of the key features of our application. This light-hearted tutorial also serves to show that our application is relevant and solves problems that the reader can relate to.

I also contributed multiple new illustrations to the developer's guide to help future contributors visualise what each command does.
The illustrations are included in my contributions below.
