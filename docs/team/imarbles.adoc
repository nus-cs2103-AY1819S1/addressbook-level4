== PROJECT: SocialCare

:sectnums:
== Overview

This portfolio page documents my involvement in SocialCare, a project done as part of the CS21303T Software Engineering module taught in NUS.
For this project, my team had the goal to _'harness the potential of software to create sustainable social change'_.

With our goal in mind, we developed SocialCare, a desktop application made for social welfare organizations.
This application is designed to help manage volunteers and events effectively. This is done through the Command Line Interface (CLI), which help users to interact with the application; and the Graphical User Interface (GUI), which displays information in a user-friendly manner.

My main role as a developer for SocialCare was to implement *record management functions*, which enable users to do the following:

* View volunteers assigned to an event
* Assign volunteers to an event
* Update volunteering records for volunteers
* Delete volunteering records of volunteers

== Summary of Contributions
* *Major enhancement*:
Added commands to *manage volunteer records*
** What it does:
The commands implemented allow users to manage volunteering records.
They will be able to assign volunteers to events and update the number of hours contributed by the volunteer.

** Justification:
These functions are part of the core requirements for the application because we want users to be able to effectively manage volunteering records.

** Highlights:
This enhancement is completely new and required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
It was challenging as to properly implement this, a complete understanding of all code components was needed.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Added a command to allow users to *switch between panels*.
** Created charts for the `overview` command.

* *Code contributed*:
