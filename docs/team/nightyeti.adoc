This portfolio aims to provide a summary of what I have contributed as a student for the project *_Heart²_*.

*_Heart²_* Github link: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main

== Introduction
image::abouttheproject.png[width="400"]

image::intropicture.png[width="200"]

*_Heart²_* is a desktop application for wedding planning agencies to efficiently manage their clients and vendors. It allows the agency to automatically match the agency's vendors to existing clients' needs, and also maintains a easy-to-use database search system for clients' and vendors' profiles.

It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX

It is cross-platform and can be compiled for both Windows and Mac OS.

*_Heart²_* was developed on top of the link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4] application. It consists of 5 dedicated members, including myself. I was the Team Lead in *_Heart²_*, and doubled up as a software engineer. I coded a `Login` feature from scratch and `Privileges` system for different types of user accounts.

image::major.png[width="400"]

=== Major enhancements

Added `login` and `logout` functions, and allow users to `register` for an user account.

* *What it does:* Allows the user to register for an account, and use that account to log in to the application. Afterwards, the user can log out of his/her account.
* *Justification:* Clients' and vendors' personal information are present in the application, and it is necessary to protect these information from unwanted eyes. Logging in to use the application is an important feature as it restricts access to the application from unauthorised parties. Without an authorised account, the user is unable to use this application as it is mandatory to log in at start.
* *Highlights:* Storing user account information was a challenge as the project restriction only allows files to be stored locally. Nonetheless, I stored user password as hash digest using `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512` algorithm with salt to prevent anyone from looking up the user's password directly. The implementation is based off this link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/2861125/3474[stackoverflow] answer.

image::minor.png[width="400"]

=== Minor enhancements

* *Minor enhancement:* Allows user to `edit password` as well as creating account access privilege with either `Super User` or `Read-Only User` role.
* *Justification:* Editing password is needed as user may want to change his/her password from time to time, especially for compromised accounts. Allocating account privileges helps in preventing unnecessary modifications to the application database. For example, an employee tasked as call-support role would be allocated `Read-Only User` role as he/she does not need to modify data in the application.

== Contributions to the User Guide

image::userguideheader.png[width="400"]
|===
|_This section shows what I have contributed to the User Guide. It showcases my ability to write documentation targetting end-user._
|===

Link to the full User Guide: link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[Github link]

=== Overview of contributions
Below is an overview of what I have contributed towards the User Guide.

==== Made the User Guide pretty
I created various graphic assets for the User Guide to make the User Guide more pleasing to read. Below are examples of some of the graphic assets I have created.

.Examples of graphics contributed
image::userguideexample.png[width="500"]

The left image above shows the overall title graphic that is present on the first page of the User Guide, and the right image shows an example of a title header to better differentiate each sections in the User Guide. This showcases my ability to create graphic assets from scratch.


==== Crafted an `example` format:

I crafted a format which was used consistently by my team throughout the entire User Guide to let users easily identify an example of a real command.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|* `client#1 addservice t/photography p/2000`
 * `client#1 addservice t/catering p/10000`
|=====

The above is the `example format` used consistently throughout the User Guide. User can simply copy `client#1 addservice t/photography p/2000` as a command and run it in the application. This allows users to copy a working command conveniently and paste it into the application to trigger the command.

==== Wrote content for the User Guide
I have written paragraphs relating to the new commands I have added to the application to teach users how to use those commands. The content I have written for the User Guide is shown below in Section 3.2.

==== *_Part A_*
image::parta.png[width="200"]

[Discrete]
=== Logging in : `login`

Securely logs you in to access the system with a registered account. By default, a root account with `SUPER_USER` privilege is provided, using the username `rootUser` and password `rootPassword`.

Format: `login u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`login u/rootUser p/rootPassword`
|=====

[Discrete]
=== Logging out : `logout`

Securely logs you out of the system.

Format: `logout`

[Discrete]
=== Registering a new account : `register account`

Register a new account for this application. You can only register a new account after logging in with a `SUPER_USER` account. By default, `rootUser` is a default account with `SUPER_USER` privilege.

Format: `register account u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD r/ROLE`

[NOTE]
`r/ROLE`: either `r/superuser` or `r/readonlyuser` to create a `SUPER_USER` account or `READ_ONLY_USER` account respectively.

[NOTE]
It may sound counter-intuitive to require an account before registering a new account. We make this requirement as only authorised personal should be given an account. Ideally, the owner of the application should dictate the account given to employees by helping them register an account.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`register account u/myNewUsername p/p@ssw0rd r/superuser`
|=====

[Discrete]
=== Change the current password : `change password`

Change your current account password from an old password to a new password.

Format: `change password o/YOUR_OLD_PASSWORD n/YOUR_NEW_PASSWORD`

[NOTE]
You cannot `undo` changing of password.

[WARNING]
New password should not be the same as old password, and it cannot be empty, or contain spaces.

[WARNING]
Make sure your password is typed correctly. There is no confirmation prompt once you execute the command.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`change password o/jf3nv n/j9y3nd`

Link to the full Developer Guide: link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[Github link]

=== Overview of contributions
Below in an overview of what I have contributed towards the Developer Guide.

==== Made the Developer Guide pretty
I created graphic assets for the Developer Guide to draw the reader's attention. This also makes the Developer Guide more aesthetically pleasing.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AccountStorage.java[`AccountStorage.java`]

The `AccountStorage` component

* can save the Account data in xml format and read it back.
* can populate a default root Account data in xml format if missing
* can update existing Account password stored in the storage

==== 4.2.2. *_Part B_*
image::partb.png[width="200"]

[Discrete]
=== Account storage
All accounts are stored in a file call `/data/accountlist.xml`. This file is generated on the fly during first launch and populated with a root account. By default, a root account is hardcoded into the application with the username `rootUser` and password `rootPassword` with the role `SUPER_USER`.

The diagram below shows what happen when a user launches the application:

.Activity diagram when user launches the application
image::accountstoragediagram.png[width="700"]

Only a `SUPER_USER` is allowed to create a new account, either for himself, or on behalf of another person. The diagram below shows what happen when a user attempts to register a new account:

.Activity diagram when user registers an account
image::accountcreationdiagram.png[width="700"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: What file type to store user account as?
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Store it as a `xml` file locally.
** Pros: The code to write and read xml file is already present for adding address book contact initially in the Address Book - level 4 app. Hence, adopting this code and modifying it for account storage is easier than coming up with code from scratch.
** Cons: Xml file is relatively wordy and verbose with all the opening and closing tags. For the same amount of account information, more data has to be stored using xml than format such as json.
* *Alternative 2:* Store it as a `json` file locally.
** Pros: Simpler syntax than `xml` and hence less data is required to store the same amount of account information.
** Pros: Can be parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.
** Cons: Not familiar with json, hence more effort is needed to write code to store account in json format, compared to the already given code for xml storage.

==== Security Considerations

===== Database
Currently, the list of accounts is stored locally on data/accountlist.xml. For security purposes, we may consider the following implementations in the future for v2.0:

* **Encrypt accountlist.xml:** This can prevent direct lookup of the file as the content is encrypted
* **Store the file on a server:** Due to project restriction, we are unable to implement this at v1.4. Storing file on a server has an added advantage of utilising web security practises or employing third party services to help protect our account list in private servers.

===== Storing password
Username is stored in plaintext in accountlist.xml, as username is not private information. However, user password is hashed with `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512` algorithm together with a `salt`, to prevent password from being visible in plaintext. `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512` is deliberately chosen as it is a link:https://adambard.com/blog/3-wrong-ways-to-store-a-password/[slower] algorithm, thus slowing down brute-force attack for finding out user password. The hashing algorithm is present in `PasswordAuthentication` class and the implementation is based off this link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/2861125/3474[stackoverflow] answer.
