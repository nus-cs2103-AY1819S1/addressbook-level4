== PROJECT: FoodZoom

---
Hello there! My name is Julius Sander, and I am a Year 2 Computer Science student
in National University of Singapore. This is a report of my contributions to my most
recent team project, FoodZoom.

== Overview

FoodZoom is a desktop food delivery management application designed for
food businesses to streamline their delivery process. FoodZoom is
responsive and quick, allowing managers to plan routes for order
delivery and dispatch them to delivery men using the Command Line
Interface (CLI). The delivery men can also use this application to view
their delivery routes and increase their efficiency. FoodZoom is built
by 5 computer science student namely Rahul Rajesh, Julius Sander, Monika
Monuela, Koh Chi Hao and Tan Jin Ying.

FoodZoomâ€™s core functionality includes:

* Users being able to track food orders (visualise on a map) they have from customers
* Managing deliverymen and assigning orders to them
* Analysis of orders to display relevant statistics (order history, trending food etc.) to users

== Summary of Contributions

---
|===
|Given below are contributions that I made to this application.
|===

* *Major enhancement*: Added deliverymen into the application.

** _What it does_: Managers can add, delete or assign order deliveries
to the deliverymen with this feature. Managers can also see and monitor
the activity of the deliverymen from the main screen.

** _Justification_: This feature provides managers the ability to manage
deliveryman independently from orders, giving them added control over
their order deliveries.

** _Highlights_: This enhancement adds new commands into the
application, and requires in-depth analysis of design analysis with
regards to information storage.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added IDs to resources for storage. This provides
the application an ability to save and load complex associations between
resources in the application.
