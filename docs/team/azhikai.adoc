== PROJECT: MeNUS
---
This portfolio aims to provide a summary of my contribution as Team Lead for the project,
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-4/main[*MeNUS*].

== Overview

*MeNUS* is a restaurant management desktop application targeting restaurant owners in the National University
of Singapore (NUS). It is built to help them better manage core aspects of their restaurants  --  accounts (i.e. employees), menus,
ingredients, sales and reservations management -- all within a single application!

Restaurant owners interact with *MeNUS* using a Command Line Interface
(CLI). *MeNUS* also has a Graphical User Interface(GUI) created with https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/[JavaFX] and it
is written using https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html[Java 9] with
approximately 30 KLoC.

It is cross-platform supported and can be used on both Windows-based and Unix-based platforms.

== Summary of Contributions
* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=azhikai[RepoSense]
* *Major enhancement*: Added the *accounts management* feature
** *What it does*: Allows the restaurant owner to create an account for each of his employee to manage the system on his
 behalf.
** *Justification*: This feature implements a security layer by ensuring that only authorised employees are able to
execute commands based on their level of privilege. In addition, it provides accountability as executed commands
can be traced back to the respective user.
** *Highlights*: This enhancement affects existing commands as certain commands will only be executed if the user is
authorised to do so. It required an in-depth analysis and understanding of the `Logic`,`Model` and `Storage`
components. Also, the implementation was challenging as it required modifications to existing commands.
** *Credits*: Passwords are secured using https://github.com/patrickfav/bcrypt[`bcrypt`].

* *Other contributions*:
