---

== Overview

Concierge(TM) is a desktop application simulating a hotel management system used by hotel owners and receptionists. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=adamwth[Code Contributed]]

* *Major enhancement*:

** Implemented `checkIn` and `checkout` commands
*** What it does: Allows the user to check-in a room's booking that is active, checkout any booking of a room,
and update the checked-in guest list and archived guest list to reflect the checked-in/out guests respectively.
*** Justification: This feature is a core feature that supports the daily operations of a hotel, without which the hotel will not
be able to function. The checking-in/out of a room's booking is a very frequent operation in a typical hotel setting.
However, it is very cumbersome to execute these operations using the existing `edit` command as it requires many fields to fill in.
This feature solves this problem by providing a command-line interface with minimal fields to specify, allowing smooth and fast
checking-in/out of rooms.

*** Highlights:
**** The validity of a check-in operation requires knowledge of how a hotel manages its policy of allowing guests to check-in.
The current implementation was finalized after experimenting with different validity checks on multiple different scenarios.
Refer to the <<Contributions to the User Guide, User Guide>> and <<Contributions to the Developer Guide, Developer Guide>>
for more information on these checks.
**** As for the checkout feature, though it was initially intended to execute similar validity checks for checking-out a booking,
it has now expanded its scope to double as a delete-booking feature.
**** Before these commands could be implemented, the underlying `Room` architecture had to be written first. Extensive
trial-and-error was conducted to decide the better alternative between mutable and immutable data, from which
the immutability paradigm emerged the victor, as it was easy to debug and made writing unit, integration, and system tests much easier.
As for the data structure of Room, Guests, and Bookings, cyclic references were shunned in favor of one-way references
(i.e. Room contains Bookings; each Booking contains a Guest). This was chosen to minimize the risk of data corruption, as it
removed the need for maintaining the synchronization of the same data in multiple places.
