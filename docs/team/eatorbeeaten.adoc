== PROJECT: Hallper

== 1. Overview

This Project Portfolio documents my contributions to Hallper.

Hallper is designed by a team of 5 Computer Science students (including myself), from the National University of Singapore (NUS).
Hallper is a desktop application designed to serve the JCRCs of NUS.
The user interacts with Hallper using a defined list of typed commands.
Hallper's interface is created with JavaFX, and the other components are written in Java.

Some of its main features are:

* Clearing and importing of multiple contacts conveniently
* Tagging contacts by categories (CCA, room, etc)
* Filtering through contacts quickly
* Viewing of contact profile
* Updating of profile pictures of contacts
* Allocating and managing the budget
* Composing emails to multiple contacts
* Updating monthly events to the calendar

** What it does: Allows the user to compose emails to recipients consisting of selected persons in Hallper.
** Justification: Amproves Hallper significantly by allowing simple email creation with specified residents as recipients.
