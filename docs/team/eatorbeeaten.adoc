== PROJECT: Hallper

== 1. Overview

This Project Portfolio documents my contributions to Hallper.

Hallper is designed by a team of 5 Computer Science students (including myself), from the National University of Singapore (NUS).
Hallper is a desktop application designed to serve the JCRCs of NUS.
The user interacts with Hallper using a defined list of typed commands.
Hallper's interface is created with JavaFX, and the other components are written in Java.

Some of its main features are:

* Convenient management of multiple contacts
* Profile view of contacts
* Budget allocation and management
* Composition of emails to multiple contacts
* Calendar to update monthly events

== 2. Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to compose emails*
** What it does: allows the user to compose emails to recipients consisting of selected persons in Hallper.
** Justification: improves Hallper significantly by allowing simple email creation with specified residents as recipients.
** Highlights: touches all components in Hallper. This made the implementation challenging as it required an understanding of all the various components.
** Credits: uses http://www.simplejavamail.org/[Simple Java Mail]

* *Minor enhancement*: added a few commands (delete_email, list_emails, view_email) to improve email manipulation in Hallper.
