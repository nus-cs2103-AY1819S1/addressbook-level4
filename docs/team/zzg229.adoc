== 1. Overview

This project portfolio documents `Zhou Zegang`’s contributions to project `PatientBook`. [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-2/main[PatientBook]]

`PatientBook` is an all-in-one convenient desktop application for medical professionals in Singapore.
It is a `Command Line Interface(CLI)` application in which doctors can type simple commands on keyboard to store and
manage patients’ data and appointments’ details easily. It can also be used to retrieve information about
diseases, symptoms and drugs.

The `T12-2` development team of `PatientBook` consists of five year-two computer science undergraduates from School of Computing,
`National University of Singapore`. [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-2/main/blob/master/docs/AboutUs.adoc[Team Info]]

`PatientBook` supports various important operations such as finding information about a patient,
adding an appointment for a patient and predicting a disease from a set of symptoms.


== 2. Summary of Contributions

This section provides an overview of `Zhou Zegang`’s contributions to project `PatientBook`.

* *Code contributed*: Code From Dashboard [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=zzg229&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-12&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[Code]]

* *Major enhancement*: added *diagnosis model which supports add disease, find disease, list disease and predict
disease commands*
** What it does: This feature allows medical professionals to `add` a disease and its related symptoms,
`find` symptoms of an existing disease,
`list` all stored diseases and `predict` a disease from a given set of symptoms in PatientBook.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a doctor can check up a disease’s symptoms
and ascertain the accuracy of the diagnosis using `predict` command. Thus, this enhancement will reduce the likelihood
of medical malpractice to a large extent.
** Highlight: This enhancement is totally another separate model from two existing models, namely `patient model` and
`appointment model`. As a result, it required an in-depth analysis of both design and integration with the other two
models. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing project structure.
** Credit: The `diagnosis model` uses an existing disease-symptom knowledge database
from `Columbia University`. [http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html[Database]]

* *Other contributions*:
** Minor enhancement:
*** designed and added a generic method which converts a list of items to an `alphabetically ordered`
string message so that it can be clearly displayed in the application.
*** Resolved CSV file reading issue for drug utility function in jar . (Pull request: [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-2/main/pull/184[#184]])
** Project management:
*** Set up Travis for team project on Travis CI
*** Assigned issues to teammates (example: [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-2/main/issues/65[#65]] )
*** Included labels for issue tracker (example: [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-2/main/labels[Label]])

== 3. Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

=== Add a disease : `add disease`

*Format:* `add disease d/DISEASE s/SYMPTOM`

Adds a new disease to the patient book.

You must include one and only one `DISEASE` parameter with prefix `d/` and at least one `SYMPTOM` for that disease
with prefix `s/`. Duplicate symptoms can be included but only one will be added into the patient book. The `DISEASE`
 and `SYMPTOM` parameter can take any characters except `comma`. Both `DISEASE` and `SYMPTOM` parameters cannot exceed
 `20` characters in length.

When you try to add an existing disease into the patient book, the following error message will be shown to you:

.Error Message for Duplicate Diseases
image::ErrorMessageForAddingExistingDisease.png[width="600"]

Hence, you may try command `find disease NAME` to find related symptoms of this existing disease.

Example:

* `add disease d/acne s/pustules s/blackheads`

.Message for Adding Disease Successfully
image::SuccessfulAddDisease.png[width="600"]

* `add disease d/alcohol misuse s/stroke s/stroke s/mouth cancer` +
Symptom 'stroke' will be included once in our record.
* `add disease d/obesity d/obesities s/overweight` +
This is an invalid command due to multiple occurrence of disease paramters. Hence, you will
be prompted to enter a correct command:

.Error Message for Duplicate Disease Parameter
image::ErrorMessageForWrongAddDiseaseCommand.png[width="600"]

* `add disease d/averylongdiseaseparameter s/dummySymptom` +
Returns an error message:

.Error Message for Long Disease Parameter
image::AddDiseaseLimit.png[width="600"]

* `add disease d/invalid,disease s/dummySymptom` +
Returns an error message:

.Error Message for Invalid Disease Parameter
image::AddDiseaseComma.png[width="600"]

=== List all diseases : `list disease`

*Format:* `list disease`

Shows a list of all diseases in alphabetic order in the patient book.

=== Locate diseases  : `find disease`

*Format:* `find disease NAME`

Finds the disease which its name is specified in the command and returns its related symptoms
displayed in alphabetic order.

* The search is case insensitive; e.g. ‘HIV’, ‘hIV’ and ‘hiv’ are all equivalent.

.Display for find disease hIV
image::FindHiv.png[width="600"]

* Only full words will be matched; e.g. ‘confus’ will not match ‘confusion’.

Example:

* `find disease influenza` +
Returns all the symptoms related to disease ‘influenza’:

.Result for Command 'find disease influenza'
image::FindDiseaseInfluenza.png[width="600"]

=== Predict disease  : `predict`

*Format:* `predict s/SYMPTOM`

Predicts a disease from a given set of symptoms.

You must include at least one `SYMPTOM` parameter with prefix `s/` to predict a disease. All
diseases that contain the set of symptoms will be returned and displayed in alphabetic order.

* The `SYMPTOM` parameter is case insensitive; e.g. ‘fever’ will match ‘FeVER’.
* Only diseases containing all the symptoms given in the command will be returned; e.g.
For command `predict s/fever s/blackout`, even if disease ‘bacteremia’ contains symptom ‘fever’,
it will not be returned since it does not contain symptom ‘blackout’.
* If none of diseases contain the given set of symptoms, an error message will be shown to you:

Example:

* `predict s/fever s/blackout` +
Returns diseases which contain the two symptoms:

.Result for Valid Command 'predict s/fever s/blackout'
image::PredictDiseaseValidDemo.png[width="600"]

* `predict s/cry` +
Returns an error message:

.Error Message for Command 'predict s/cry'
image::PredictDiseaseInvalidDemo.png[width="600"]

* `predict s/` +
Returns an error message:

.Error Message for Empty Symptom Parameter
image::PredictEmptySymptom.png[width="600"]

=== Diagnosis

==== Current Implementation

The diagnosis feature is facilitated by `Diagnosis` class. This class contains a private attribute called
`matcher` of type `HashMap<Disease, Set<Symptom>>`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `Diagnosis#hasDisease(Disease disease)` – Check if the application contains the `disease` input by users
* `Diagnosis#getSymptoms(Disease disease)` – Return a `list` of all the related `symptoms` of a `disease` input by users
* `Diagnosis#getDiseases()` – Return a `list` of existing `diseases` from the database
* `Diagnosis#addMatcher(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms)` – Store a particular `disease` with its set of `symptoms` in database.
* `Diagnosis#predictDisease(Set<Symptom> symptoms)` – Predict a `disease` for a set of `symptoms` input by users.

These operations are exposed in the `DiagnosisModel` interface as
`DiagnosisModel# hasDisease(Disease disease)`,
`DiagnosisModel#getSymptoms(Disease disease)`, `DiagnosisModel#getDiseases()`,
`DiagnosisModel#addMatcher(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms)` and
`DiagnosisModel#predictDisease(Set<Symptom> symptoms)` respectively.

.Diagnosis Class Diagram
image::DiagnosisClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `diagnosis` mechanism behaves at each step:

.Sequence Diagram
image::DiagnosisSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `Diagnosis` will be instantiated and its
private attribute `matcher` will be initialized by calling the `static` method `Diagnosis#readDataFromCsvFile()`.

Step 2. The user executes `find disease Influenza` command to get symptoms of “Influenza” stored in the patient book.
The `find disease` command calls `DiagnosisModel#hasDisease(Disease disease)` first, if the return `Boolean` value is `false`,
the user will be notified with a `command exception` thrown . If the return value is `true`, it will continue to call
`DiagnosisModel#getSymptoms(Disease disease)` and get all the `symptoms` related to “Influenza” in a `List<Symptom>`.

Step 3. If the disease is not present in the database record, the user can execute
`add disease d/Influenza s/ncoordination s/fever s/pleuritic pain…` command to insert the data into the database record.
Now, the `add disease` command calls `DiagnosisModel#addMatcher(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms)`.
Now it will call the `static` method `writeDataFromCsvFile(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms)` which returns
a `Hashmap` of type `HashMap<Disease, Set<Symptom>>` and assigns it to `this.matcher` to update the `private` attribute.

.Add Command Code Snippet
[source,java]
----
    /**
     * Adds a disease and its related symptoms into the database
     *
     * @param disease  disease input.
     * @param symptoms related symptoms.
     */


    public void addMatcher(Disease disease, Set<Symptom> symptoms) {
        requireNonNull(disease);
        requireAllNonNull(symptoms);
        boolean hasDisease = this.hasDisease(disease);
        if (!hasDisease) {
            this.matcher = writeDataToCsvFile(disease, symptoms);
        }
    }
----

Step 4. The user executes `list disease` command to get a list of diseases stored in the patient book.
The `list disease` command calls `DiagnosisModel#getDiseases()` which returns a `list` of diseases present in the
`key set of matcher`.

Step 5. Now the user decides to execute the command `predict` to search for a `disease` in database that
matches with input symptoms. This command calls `DiasnosisModel#predictDisease(Set<Symptom>)` which returns a `list`
of diseases that are mapped to a set of symptoms containing the given set.


.Predict Command Code Snippet
[source,java]
----
    /**
     * Predicts a disease with a given set of symptoms.
     *
     * @param symptoms symptoms input.
     * @return a list of qualified diseases.
     */
    public List<Disease> predictDisease(Set<Symptom> symptoms) {
        requireAllNonNull(symptoms);
        List<Disease> diseases = this.matcher.keySet().stream()
                .filter(disease -> this.matcher.get(disease).containsAll(symptoms)).collect(Collectors.toList());
        diseases.sort(Comparator.comparing(Disease::toString));
        return diseases;
    }

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Disease-symptom matching data structures

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `HashMap` where the `key` and `value` are the disease and set of
related symptoms respectively.
** Pros: Better performance in terms of efficiency; duplicate values are also eliminated.
** Cons: Difficult for other developers to understand.
* **Alternative 2:** Define a `Match` class with two private attributes representing the disease and a set of
related symptoms, then maintain a `list` of `Match` objects.
** Pros: Easy for new developers to understand when disease-symptom pairs are encapsulated in an object.
** Cons: May take up more memory, leading to performance issues.

===== Aspect: Searching algorithm to support disease prediction operation

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `stream` to search and collect all potential diseases.
** Pros: Easy to implement and easy for new developers to understand.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of lower efficiency.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a more systematic way to determine the suitability of each disease by
calculating the similarity of its pre-existing set of symptoms and the set of symptoms given by users.
** Pros: More accurate in determining the correct diseases.
** Cons: Hard to implement and understand.
