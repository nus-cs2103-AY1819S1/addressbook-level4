== PROJECT: EventOrganiser

---

== Overview

EventOrganiser is an application for managing and organising events built for NUS students. It is optimized for those
who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Summary of

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to specify friendships among users
** What it does: Allows the users to add or delete users from their friend lists and have their friend lists displayed
** Justification: This feature allows users to keep a list of friends where they can be updated of their details and the events that they join, similar to following someone on Instagram. For example, a user can look through the displayed profile of the users in their friend list to see what are the current events that they are in. Also, this feature allows users to search for friends with common interests and add them into their friend lists.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a new attribute Interest for a user
** Justification: The original tag attribute allows users to specify the groups that they are associated with (eg faculty and tutorial class names). This new Interest attribute allows users to specify the things that they are interested in (eg hobbies). This improves the connectivity among users in the Event Organiser as they can now find friends through common interests.
