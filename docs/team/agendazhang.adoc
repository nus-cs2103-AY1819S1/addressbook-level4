== PROJECT: EventOrganiser

---

== Overview

EventOrganiser is an application for managing and organising events built for NUS students. It is optimized for those
who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Summary of

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to specify friendships among users
** What it does: Allows the user to login and logout of EventOrganiser
** Justification: This feature enforces some level of authorisation for our application so that some commands are only accessible by specific users

* *Minor enhancement*: Added an all encompassing command that allows users to find other users based on their name, phone number, address, email, interests, and tags

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=yao-feng[Functional code]]
