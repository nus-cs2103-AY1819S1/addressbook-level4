== Overview

EventOrganiser is a desktop application for organisation and management of events.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of

* *Major enhancement*: added *Event and Poll commands and functionality*.

** What it does: Event-related commands allow event organisers to create, edit and manage events, and users to find and join events.
 Poll-related commands allow the event organiser to create polls and for participants to vote in the poll.
** Justification: Events are essential to the event organiser. Polls in the Event are useful for event organisers to decide on a suitable activity, date and time for the event.
** Highlights:
*** Updated all components: logic, model, storage, UI to support events and polls
*** Integrated Persons into Events: Persons are stored in events by index in storage and in runtime, and events are updated when user are edited or deleted.
*** Implemented dependencies between commands e.g. users should select events before editing
