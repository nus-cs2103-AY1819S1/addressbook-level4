== Summary of

* *Major enhancement*: added *Event and Poll commands and functionality*.

 Poll-related commands allow event organiser to create polls and for participants to vote in the poll.
** Justification: Event-related commands are essential to the event organiser. Polls are useful for users to decide on a suitable activity, date and time for the event.
** Highlights:
*** Updated all components: logic, model, storage, UI to support event and polls
*** Integrated Persons into Events: Persons are stored in events by index in storage and in runtime, and events are updated when user are edited or deleted.
*** Implemented dependencies between commands e.g. users should select events before editing
