== PROJECT: EventOrganiser

---

EventOrganiser is a desktop application for organisation and management of events.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of

* *Major enhancement*: added *Event and Poll commands and functionality*. +
Event related commands: DeleteEvent, SelectEvent, JoinEvent, SetDate, SetTime, FindEvent, FindEventByTime +
Poll related commands: AddPoll, AddPollOption, AddTimePoll, DisplayPoll, VoteCommand

** What it does: Allows users to create, organise and sign-up for events, and create polls and vote for options in the poll.
** Justification: The event related commands are essential to the event organiser. Polls are useful for users to decide on a suitable activity, date and time for the event.
** Highlights:
*** Updated all components: logic, model, storage, UI to support event and polls
*** Integrated Persons into Events: Persons are stored in events by index in storage, and events contain persons in runtime (eg in participant lists and voter lists).
Person details within events update when persons are deleted or edited.
*** Implement dependencies between commands: e.g. user must be logged in, event must be selected, user must be the event organiser,
user must have joined the event are pre-conditions for using several commands
