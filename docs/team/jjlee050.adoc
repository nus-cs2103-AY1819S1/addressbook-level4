== PROJECT: ClinicIO

---

== 1. Overview

This portfolio summarises my contributions made throughout the project.

ClinicIO is a project from CS2103T intended for students to learn Software Engineering at an entry-level.

ClinicIO is a clinic management desktop application that allows receptionists to manage a clinic with ease and efficiency.
ClinicIO can be used to manage patient records, queues, medical inventory, appointments as well as view detailed statistics.

As the team lead, I am responsible for the overall team coordination. This involves providing a clear set of goals and directions for the team, overseeing the whole project and listening to teammates feedback for improvements.
Furthermore, I am also in charge of Scheduling and Tracking, Deliverables and Deadlines. This involves
defining, assigning, and tracking project tasks, ensuring that project deliverables is produced on time and in the right format.

As a developer, I am in charge of the UI component of this program. This involves understanding
how UI is managed in this project and to ensure that the UI component of this project is well maintained.

See below for more details on my contributions for the duration of 10 weeks.

* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=jjlee050[My Codes]

* *Major enhancement*:
** Added *Patient Management* feature (Main Enhancement)
*** What it does: This feature provide a centralised patient for the user to manage the clinic patients record.
*** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
*** Highlights: This enhancement is integrated alongside with queue, appointment and data commands to provide a cohesive system.
It requires an in-depth understanding of ClinicIO's architecture.

** Added *User Authentication* feature
*** What it does: This feature allows the user to login to ClinicIO to gain access to ClinicIO record. Users can logout of ClinicIO to change account.
*** Justification: This feature provide more security to ensure that user has the appropriate rights to access the commands.
*** Highlights: This enhancement affects both existing commands and commands that would be added in the future. The implementation was challenging as all commands is relying on this feature to run the system more securely and efficiently.
