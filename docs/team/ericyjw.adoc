== PROJECT: Hallper

---

== 1) Overview

The purpose of this portfolio is to document the contributions I have done to the project and provide an overview of
what the project is about.

This project is undertaken by myself and four other Computer Science students as part of our Software Engineering
module. Titled as Hallper, our project is a desktop application specially designed for the Junior Common Room
Committee (JCRC). The JCRC is a student representative body from every Hall in National University of Singapore,
responsible for managing student affairs. Hallper aims to facilitate the JCRC in its day-to-day management by
providing a combined platform that encompasses different functions that are mainly used by the JCRC. This allows the
JCRC to carry out its  duties more efficiently and systematically.

To use Hallper, the user keys in specific commands to create emails, calendar events and manage the Hall's
budget -- all of the main concerns of the JCRC addressed on a single platform.


== 2) Summary of contributions
These are my personal contributions to the project:

* *Major enhancement 1*: added *the budget feature*
** What it does: It allows the user to allocate budgets to the CCAs and key in future transactions to keep
track of each CCA's spending.
** Justification: This feature improves Hallper's functionality where it provides an extra option to assist the user
in managing finances and monitor the hall's budget more easily. By centralising the different CCAs' spending onto
 a centralised platform, the user can manage hall finances in a more straightforward manner.
** Highlights: The budget feature adds on to the existing address book and creates a separate budget book to store
new information regarding the CCAs, their budget and spending. The tags used in the address book are used to
link the address book and budget book together. The budget feature requires in-depth understanding of
the source code as it adds and deletes CCAs and transactions, similar to adding and deleting a person in an address
book.

* *Major enhancement 2*: added *the budget window*
** What it does: It opens up another window that displays the list of CCAs available and their transaction history.
** Justification: This feature improves the user experience as the user can obtain the financial information of each
CCA easily. The separate window allows the user to go back to the main Hallper window easily when he wants to look up
 for a person in the address book. The separate windows allow the user to tend to financial matters while searching
 for the person-in-charge concurrently.
** Highlights: This budget window requires a deep understanding of Java FXML API, JavaFX and XML, and how they work
together. It is challenging as it requires interaction with the main window.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a F2 button to allow the user to switch between the budget window and the main Hallper
window.
