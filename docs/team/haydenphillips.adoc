== PROJECT: JxMusic

---

== Overview

JxMusic is a desktop music player application developed as a school project for the learning of Software
Engineering principles. The project is built upon https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level4/[AddressBook(Level 4)].
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions:

* *Major enhancement*:
Playlist Management
*** What it does: Allows the ability to add to, delete from, and search for playlists within the music library.
*** Justification: Allows the user to organise their music collection to suit their listening preferences. Users can sort their music by creating playlist based on genre, likeability, age etc.
The user can easily search through large collections of music via the search command.
When the playlist is no longer used or needed, one can simply delete.
*** Highlights:
Playlist names can allow not just single words, but phases.
Searching for a playlist has been made easier by utilising the ability to find matching sub-strings of the playlist names.
Can create a new playlist while simultaneously adding tracks to the playlist

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the ability to pause a track that is currently playing
