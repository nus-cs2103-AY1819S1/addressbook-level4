Welcome to my project portfolio. I am Benjamin and I am a computing science student.
This project portfolio will detail the contributions I have made to various Software Engineering projects.


== Project Overview: MeetingBook

MeetingBook is a desktop scheduler application targeted at university students involved in multiple
Co-Curricular Activities and Project-Based modules. The application is a modified contact book with features to group
contacts and assign meetings to such groups. MeetingBook is written by a team of 5 students from National University
of Singapore's School of Computing. It is forked from
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level4]
written by https://se-edu.github.io/[SE-EDU].

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: enhanced the `find` command.

** What it does prior: the `find` command filters the displayed list of persons based on the keywords given.
Upon execution, the list displays persons whose name consists at least one of the keywords given.

** What it does after enhancement:
*** The user can add an additional parameter specifying whether to search for groups, meetings, or persons.
*** The user can put the keywords into 3 categories: a set of keywords where the results must match all given keywords,
a set of keywords where the results must match at least one of the given keywords,
and a set of keywords where the results must not match any of the given keywords.

** Justification: The extension of the `find` command allows the user to better manage their MeetingBook.
When there is a large amount of data in the MeetingBook,
the user will have an easier time searching for what they need.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a `sort` command that allows the user to sort the displayed list of persons by
name, phone number, email address, or home address by lexicographical order.
