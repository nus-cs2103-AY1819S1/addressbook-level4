== PROJECT: JxMusic

== Overview

JxMusic is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for listening to music. More importantly, JxMusic is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Summary of contributions

* https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=gongjie663746[*Code contributed*]
* *Major enhancement*: *Storage* component of Jxmusic
** What it does: Enable the app to save the Library’s Playlist information into JSON file, read from library to initialize library class, and scan all valid mp3 files in the /library folder.
** Justification: It is important in this application because it allows the user to have their playlists information stored. Furthermore, it loads the library folder’s mp3 files and display them on the track panel.
** Highlights: This enhancement takes the edge cases into considerations when the library folder is empty or does not exist, it can extract a default library from resource folder of the application.
* *Other Contributions*:
** Minor enhancements: Added Track List Command and Track Search Command, which allow users to navigate the all the tracks available in the library folder, and search tracks using keywords.
