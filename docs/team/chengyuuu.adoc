== PROJECT: iScheduler Xs Max

---

== Overview

iScheduler Xs Max is a desktop scheduler application morphed from the original Address Book sample application (Level 4). As its name suggests, it is used for scheduling events. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *commands that allow users to manage their events in a scheduler*
** What it does: The `add` command allows user to create either single or repeated events in the scheduler.
The `edit` and `delete` command is used to `edit` and `delete` single or repeated events.
** Justification: These features are important because it allow students to keep track of their past, present and future schedules which enables them to have better time management.
** Highlights:  This enhancement involves adding commands to aid in scheduling of events. Updates were made to various components such as `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage`.
A singleton pattern class `RepeatEventGenerator` was also created to assist in generating repeated events.
