desktop app to manage their shop inventory. More importantly, it is optimized for those
who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of
a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It will allow various users to perform multiple inventory

and more. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created
with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
