== PROJECT: ResuMaker

---

== Overview

This document details my contribution to ResuMaker - a fast and flexible resume generator. ResuMaker was built by five students, including myself. It is optimised for students in the School of Computing.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added support for contextual awareness
** What it does: allows the user to *communicate with the application via slang*. The application's ability to understand slang is quite configurable. Moreover, the user can choose to *auto-populate resume entries for events that have standard information*, such as university modules or programmes.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows users to control the application using language that is more convenient for them.
** Highlights: This enhancement is built to be configurable - the user can add on to the set of slang that is understood by the application.
** Code contributed: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=anubh-v&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-12&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[link to RepoSense profile]
