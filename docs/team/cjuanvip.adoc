== PROJECT: TutorPal

---

== Overview

TutorPal is a desktop application used by private home tutors for managing student information. The useage is primarily through CLI. It is written in Java.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: implemented the *Filter command* in aspect of *fee* *grade* *timeslot* *education*
** What it does:
***FilterByFee enable user to read the list of students whose tuition fee is equal or larger than the given minimal limit fee.
***FilterByGrade enable user to read the list of students whose gradeslist include the given grade range from a to b.
***FilterByEducation enable user to read the list of students whose education level is the same.
***FilterByTimeSlot enable user to get the student whose timeslot is the same as input timeslot.
** Justification: Filter is an important command for the user to search according to different features, given the range and
list the qualified students can provide a simple review in aspect to certain features.

* *Major enhancement*: implemented the *exchange Time command*
** What is does: To exchange the time slot between two students whose education is the same.
** Justification: Since it is not allowed to simply add the new time slot when a time slot is already
be taken, so exchanging Time between two students is different from simply delete and add time slot,
this command allow two student to exchange their time slot without bringing any crush on time slots.

* *Major enhancement*: implemented the *Suggestion command*
** What is does: To provide suggestion to students according to his or her average grades.
** Justification: This command allow user to clearly see the overall performance of certain students
by analysing the average grades. If the student has not taken any exams yet, there is no suggestion gonna
be provided.
