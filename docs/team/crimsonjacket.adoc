== PROJECT: modsUni


== 1. Overview

*modsUni* is a desktop candidature management application created by university students for students.
It aims to make the tedious process of planning your entire candidature easier and more effective.
It provides students with the ability to view module details and manage their personal candidature plans.

Targeted at individuals who prefer the use of their keyboards over a click-and-point interface,
it incorporates an in-built Command Line Interface(CLI) for the majority of its user interactions and
a simple Graphical User Interface(GUI) for the displaying of output.

This project is initiated by a team of 5. Tasked to morph an existing open-source project consisting of ~10k lines of base code to a completely distinct application.
