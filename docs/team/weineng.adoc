== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *set and change password to the application*
** What it does: Allow user to set password and change password for the app, so that critical comments that affects statistical integrity (Transection summery & Tax-filing) cannot be performed by unauthorised personnel.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because only authorized users are now able use the critical commands (E.g. `delete` command) to delete loans, which affects critical summery including tax-filling, revenue management.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the security of the application and how existing commands and commands can leverage this in future release. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: Soon...
