== PROJECT: Deadline Manager

This portfolio serves to document my contributions in a team-based project for CS2103T Software Engineering. The module spans 6 weeks, culminating in a final product: Deadline Manager that is designed with features catering to students from NUS School of Computing. The project is completed with a team of 5 members, and our portfolios are located at https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w17-4.github.io/main/AboutUs.html[team page].

== Overview

Deadline Manager is an easy-to-use application to assist students in managing deadlines. Interacting through a Command Line Interface (CLI), users can easily manage their schedules and focus on what is most important. Deadline Manager is written in Java and builds upon AddressBook Level 4, a code base originally designed to teach Software Engineering principles. For more information and to take our project for a test run, please visit our home page [https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w17-4.github.io/main[on GitHub]].

== Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to import to and export from Deadline Manager*
** What it does: This feature allows users to export a selection of tasks to a file. This file can be shared with friends, who can then import it to their own Deadline Manager. Furthermore, users can export their tasks as Comma Separated Values (CSV) format, which is compatible with other major Calendar applications.
** Justification: Our Deadline Manager is targeted at users within NUS School of Computing. As most assignments/deadlines are common to the entire module, the ability to import/export tasks is essential as it allows students to share and remind each other of their schedules. Furthermore, even professors can make use of the import/export feature to update and remind students of upcoming assessments. The ability to export as CSV format further improves the user experience, as users can switch seamlessly to other major Calendar services such as Google Calendar.
** Highlights: It is necessary to account for the various file I/O operations behaviour on different Operating Systems, and extensive testing is required. Furthermore, significant design consideration is required to ensure optimal user experiences are there are many potential usage scenarios. For example, it is likely that users may import duplicate tasks. To cater to the different scenarios, an entire ImportConflictResolver class is implemented to provide flexibility and simplicity for the user when importing.
** Credits: The resource at https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118?hl=en[CSV format compatible with Google Calendar] provides specifications for exporting in CSV format.

* *Minor enhancement*: changed how parameters are parsed by the app.
** What it does: This enhancement makes changes to the parser so that an appropriate error will be thrown when the user provides duplicate parameters. This is in contrast to AddressBook - Level 4, where the app ignores repeated parameters (e.g. specify `name` more than once).

** Justification: The previous implementation can be confusing for the user as Deadline Manager silently ignores repeated parameters. The enhancement instead provides visual alert to the user so that erroneous commands can be rectified.

[NOTE]
Due to space constraints, detailed technical implementation of inter-component communication is omitted, and an overview is presented below in <<Sequence Flow, Sequence Flow>> instead. You may wish to refer to the https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w17-4.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#inter-component-communication[Developer Guide] for details.

[NOTE]
Due to space constraints, the step-by-step description for the import sequence diagram is omitted as the process is similar to export. Please refer to the https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w17-4.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#sequence-flow-2[Developer Guide] for details.

[NOTE]
Due to space constraints, detailed technical discussion of the CSV implementation is omitted, and is summarised with the following Sequence Diagram instead. This diagram is also replicated in https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w17-4.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#Design-Storage[`Storage`].

Notably, `TaskCollectionReadStorage` and `TaskCollectionWriteStorage` represents the disk reading and writing capabilities respectively; file format implementations can choose to support reading only, writing only, or both.

[NOTE]
Due to limited space in the PPP, an aspect on supporting different file formats is omitted. Please refer to  https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w17-4.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html#aspect-how-to-support-different-file-formats[the Developer Guide] for more details.
