== Overview

This project portfolio serves to document the work that I have contributed to the software, SSENISUB, during my time as a student of CS2103 (Software Engineering),
under the team T13-2 in the National University of Singapore (NUS).

SSENISUB is a software that aims to improve workplace productivity. It assists the Human Resource (HR) department to better manage the employees in the company, it also serves as a tool for
managers to better manage their staff and lastly, serve as a contact list for users to find and contact other staff within the company or department.
This software consists of about 15 kLoC and it makes use of both the Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to
interact with the user.

My role as a developer in the team was to implement finance related functions for the software. Specifically, I have implemented the Salary, Overtime Hours,
 Overtime Rate and Pay Deductibles fields for a Staff to allow the Human Resource sector to better manage their staff's payroll.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=NgeowXiuQi[Functional code]]

* *Major enhancement 1*: Implemented four new fields for a staff, namely : Salary, Overtime Hours, Overtime Rate and Pay Deductibles.
** What it does: This feature allows the HR department to store all payroll aspects for a staff and ensure that they are properly accounted for.
** Justification: This feature not only allows the staff to ensure that he/she is being paid the right amount, but also helps the HR department to store these information in their records and edit them whenever necessary. Thus, this removes
the need for paper records of pay which may result in confusion and loss of records.
** Highlights: The four new fields are able to behave seamlessly as part of the Staff and behaves just like the other attributes would like with Phone and Address.

* *Major enhancement 2*: Modified the edit function to be able to edit the four new fields implemented above.
** What it does: This feature allows the HR department to edit the Salary, Overtime Hours, Overtime Rate and Pay Deductibles on an existing staff.
** Justification: A HR staff can now edit the abovementioned fields to adjust any of the fields. Such a feature is critical as it affects a staff's payroll, and we would not want
the staff to be wrongly paid. Additionally, this function is of utmost importance as a person's salary, overtime hours and pay deductibles would change regularly. Hence, this feature is needed to manage to staff's payroll.
** Highlights: The HR staff would also be able to edit the four fields whenever necessary to allow changes (such as a pay raise or when the staff has worked more overtime hours than initially recorded).

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Tweaked the staff panel to be able to display the net salary. This required some very minor calculations to be done in the backend.
 Net salary in this case refers to the final salary calculated after all additions and deductions are taken into account. (Pull Request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T13-2/main/pull/53[#53])
