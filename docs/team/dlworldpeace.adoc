== Introduction

Hi there! I am Delong, currently a second year student at National University of Singapore major in Computer Science.  +

I like building things from scratch. Since young, I like building LEGO. And ever
after starting to programme, I fell in love with it and enjoy creating my own web
app, phone app and software.

This project is part of a Software Engineering module (CS2103T) that I have taken.
Together with my teammates, Keith, Zhuanyu, Yurou and Alvin, I would like to present
_Car park Finder_ to you.

== Project Overview: `Car park Finder`

Car park finder is a desktop address book application to find HDB (Housing Development Board) car parks in Singapore.
It allows you to work with a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* to display a list of car parks with the convenience of simply typing.
If you *use the computer frequently* and *commute by driving*, you would find our application useful in helping you obtain various information about car parks.

== Summary of contributions

Here is the list of my contributions to this project, ranging from adding features to documentations:

* *Major enhancement*: Add auto-complete feature to commands that require parameters.
** What it does: It prompts the user the full format of a command.
** Justification: It improves the product significantly because some of our commands can have up to three parameters. Memorising the full format is time-consuming.
** Highlights: This enhancement allows the user to highlight the next parameter placeholder after one placeholder is filled up.

* *Minor enhancement*: Add command abbreviation feature to most frequently used commands.
** What it does: It allows the user to type less for the same functionality.
** Justification: It improves the product significantly because command words can be long and typed wrongly easily.
** Highlights: This enhancement is very intuitive and thus easy to use.

== Contributions to the User Guide

Here is the list of my contributions to the User Guide. They showcase my ability
to write documentation for end-users to understand easily. We are targeting car
owners, e.g. taxi drivers.


=== Abbreviation: abbrev.

If you find the command words too long to type. Guess what? We have executable short form
for each command in our command list.

You can find abbreviations of each command in the table that we provide to each section from 3.1 to 3.19.

[NOTE]
However, there are ambiguous abbreviations that are not distinguishable between multiple commands.
Thus, you *CANNOT* use them: `c`, `f`, `fi`, `h`.

To see how useful it can be, please take a look at the examples below.

==== Example: Calculate Command

Step 1. Instead of entering `calculate` into the _Command Box_, you can enter `ca` instead.

Step 2. complete the rest of the fields with `TJ39 SUN 7.00AM 9.00PM`, followed by pressing Enter to execute.


=== Autocomplete: Tab

If you forgotten how to type a command, do not worry! By typing in the first letter of the command in the
_Command Box_ and pressing the Tab key, it will display the full format of the command.

[NOTE]
====
Only available for the following commands: +
[underline]#<<Features-Select, `select`>># | [underline]#<<Features-Find, `find`>># | [underline]#<<Features-Filter, `filter`>># |
[underline]#<<Features-Notify, `notify`>># | [underline]#<<Features-Calculate, `calculate`>>#
====

To see how useful it can be, please take a look at the examples below.

==== Example: Select Command

Step 1. Enter `s` into the _Command Box_, followed by pressing Tab.
Your `select` command will be completed.

Step 2. Substitute the selected field `INDEX` with `1`, followed by pressing Enter to execute.

==== Example: Filter Command

Step 1. Enter `fil` into the _Command Box_, followed by pressing Tab.
Your `filter` command will be completed.

Step 2. Substitute the selected field `DAY` with `SUN`, followed by pressing Tab to move to the next field.

Step 3. Repeat step 2 until you substitute all the fields with actual value. (You can remove those fields you
choose not to use). Then press Enter to execute.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._
|===

=== Architecture overview

This section explains the design architecture used by the entire system.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.


.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_architecture diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App,
 which contains 6 <<Architecture-Components,*`architecture components`*>> and
 adopts an <<Architecture-design,*`events-driven nature`*>>.

[[Architecture-Components]]
=== Architecture components

This section will briefly introduce the function of each architecture components
as well as common behaviours.

.Architecture Components
|===
|Component |Main Function

|<<Design-Main,*`Main`*>>
|the starting point of the system, which encapsulates the other components.

|<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>>
|represents a collection of classes used by multiple components.

|<<Design-Ui,*`User Interface`*>>
|contains the user interface classes used by the application.

|<<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>
|execute user commands, also known as the command executor.

|<<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>
|holds the data of the application in-memory.

|<<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>
|which allows reading and writing of data to the hard disk.
|===

[NOTE]
Each of the User Interface, Logic, Model, Storage Components also:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the *_class diagram_* given below) defines it's API in the `Logic` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


[[Design-Main]]
=== Main component

The `Main` component consists of only one class, link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* At app launch: initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them with one another.
* At shut down: shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Commons component

The `Commons` component consists of classes used by multiple other components. Two of these classes play important roles at the architectural level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

[NOTE]
Classes used by multiple components are put in the seedu.carparkfinder.commons package.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== User interface component

The `User Interface` (`UI`) component consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of different parts.
The base class
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`] uses _JavaFx UI_ framework.

Please refer to the *_class diagram_* below for more details on how they are connected.

.Structure of the User Interface component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

In general, this is the workflow of the `UI` component:

. Execute user commands using the `Logic` component.
. Bind itself to some data in the `Model` so that the `UI` components can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
. Respond to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the `UI` components accordingly.

All `UI` parts, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. The layout for each
component is defined in matching `.fxml` files and can be found in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.

For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`]
is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

[[Design-Logic]]


[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The `Model` component is managed by the `ModelManager` that stores the data of Car Park Finder.
It does not depend on any of the three other components.
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`] is the base class.


Please refer to the *_class diagram_* below for more details.

.Structure of the Model Component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


In general, this is the structure of the `Model` Component:

* The `ModelManager` extends the `Model` Interface.

* It stores a `VersionedCarparkFinder` and a `UserPref` object.
** The `UserPref` object represents the user's preferences.
** The `VersionedCarparkFinder` contains a `carparkFinderStateList` which is used to store multiple `Carpark` objects.


* The `ModelManager` also manages a filtered list of `Carpark` objects filtered from the `carparkFinderStateList`.

* The `Model component` exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Carpark>` that can be 'observed'
e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that it automatically updates when data in the list changes.


[NOTE]
As a OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in Car Park Finder, which `Carpark` can reference.
This would allow Car Park Finder to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of
each `Carpark` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below.
 +

.Use of Tag object
image::ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]



[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

The `Storage` component, managed by the `StorageManager`, serves as a backend storage for data of Car Park Finder.
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`] is the base class.

Please refer to the *_class diagram_* below for more details on how they are connected.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[localcopy]]
The `Storage` component can perform the following functions:

* save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* save the Car Park Finder data in xml format and read it back.

=== Abbreviation

The abbreviation feature reduces the amount of characters needed to type.

==== Overview

The abbreviation mechanism is facilitated by `CarparkFinderParser`. It extends the cases
to allow command abbreviations to be parsed through `parseCommand` as well.

==== Example

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the abbreviation mechanism behaves at
each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `LogicManager`
is initialized with an `CarparkFinderParser`.

Step 2. The user executes `c` command instead of `calculate`. The `Matcher` object in
`CarparkFinderParser` splits the command text into _command word_ and
_arguments_, in which the _command word_ is checked. Because it is an ambiguous abbrevation
(we do not know if it stands for `clear` or `calculate`), it is rejected by throwing a `ParseException`

Step 2. The user now tries `s` command instead of `select`. The `Matcher` object in
`CarparkFinderParser` again splits the command text into _command word_ and
_arguments_, in which the _command word_ is checked. This time, it is checked that the input string
is contained in one of the command words that is `calculate`. Therefore, it proceeds as if a
`select` command is given.

.Flow chart of command abbreviation usage.
image::ActivityDiagram-abbreviation.png[width="880", align="left"]

The _Activity Diagram_ above explains what happens when a user executes a `f`
command.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How abbreviation executes

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* use input string to check if it is contained in any
command word string
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Extra logic needed
|Cons| Very short command words that contains ambiguous abbreviation is marginalised in this case.
For example, the shortest form of `find` is `fin`, which makes not much of a difference.
|===
+

* *Alternative 2:* (previous choice):* declare `COMMAND_ABBREVIATION` with a string value
in each Command file.
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Easy to implement
|Cons| Have to decide on each abbreviation subjectively which brings down performance
if there are a lot of commands
|===

=== Autocomplete

The autocomplete feature simplifies overcomplicated commands by prompting correct format.

==== Overview

The autocomplete mechanism is facilitated by `CommandBox`. It calls `autocomplete()`
to `displayFormat()` if applicable command word is entered or to highlight the next
parameter if full format is already provided in the command box.

==== Example

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the autocomplete mechanism behaves at
each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user enters `fi` in command box and then presses Tab . `autoComplete()`
compares `input` through the list of applicable command words and abbreviations, and
proceeds to `displayFormat()` because `fi` is an ambiguous COMMAND, it fails with an exception.

Step 3. User tries with `fil` again. It passes as part of the autocomplete command `filter`
thus moves on to highlight its first placeholder, `DAY`, in the command line. As seen
from the following diagrams.

.After `fil` is entered.
image::screenshot-fi.png[width="800", align="left"]

.After Tab is pressed for the first time.
image::screenshot-fiFirstArgSelected.png[width="800", align="left"]

Step 3. The user replaces `DAY` with an actual value, `SUN`, and presses 'Tab'
key again. `autoComplete()` is called again, but because this time it checks that `input`
`isFilterCommandFormat`, the next placeholder, `START_TIME`, is highlighted. Result
is shown in the following diagram.

.After Tab is pressed for the second time.
image::screenshot-fiSecondArgSelected.png[width="800", align="left"]

Step 4. The user continues step 3 until all placeholders are filled up with actual
values and then presses Enter to execute this command.

.Activity Diagram for Auto Completion Mechanism.
image::ActivityDiagram-autocompletion.png[width="880", align="left"]

The _Activity Diagram_ above explains what happens when user presses Tab.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: TextInput

* *Alternative 1:* (current choice): Continue to use the original TextField
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| External library enables bindAutocompletion for TextField (the drop down
list of suggested commands that appears and updates itself as user types).
External library enables bindAutocompletion for TextField (the drop down list of
 suggested commands that appears and updates itself as user types).
|Cons| Text formatting is limited. All text in the TextField must have the same format.
|===

* *Alternative 2:* Create additional TextField as user request on additional fields
+
[cols="1,10"]
|===
|Pros| Allows for different formatting for different fields (Commands can have a
 different colour from the fields)
|Cons|Original structure will be disrupted. Command box will no longer be single
line text input, which have consequences such as the user cannot backspace or
select through the entire line.
|===
