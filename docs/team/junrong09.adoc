== Summary of contributions
* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=junrong09[Functional
code]]

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to manage and manipulate recipes*
** Multi-line Add Recipe Functionality
*** What it does: Allow users to add a recipe in progression using multi-line command .

*** Justification: The multi-line add recipe command improves the product by providing a intuitive yet convenient way
 to create a recipe entry as opposite to forcing users to input a lengthy recipe entry containing a number of instructions into a single command.

*** Highlights: This enhancement requires the handling of a incomplete recipe data when the add is being executed in
progression by the user. The challenges faced include morphing address book into a nested recipe data structure that
stores instructions which stores ingredients. Secondly, the analysis and design to create a in-progress recipe
instance that allows the appending of more recipe details when the user contributes to the incomplete recipe. Thirdly,
the retention and accessing of this incomplete recipe in order to appending the details and ultimately create an
actual recipe instance to be stored in the model.

** All-field Recipe Search
*** What it does: Retrieve recipes with name, difficulty, cooktime or ingredients that matches the keywords by the user.

*** Justification: This feature improves the application because users can now narrow down their wanted recipes based other parameters such as difficulty, cooktime and ingredients rather than restricting their search to just the name of
 the recipe.

*** Highlights: Ingredients are being stored in each instructions of a recipe, as such to support the search of
ingredients, the design of a recipe data to provide ease of access to all ingredients is required.
** Other Associated Functionality implemented: Edit Recipe
