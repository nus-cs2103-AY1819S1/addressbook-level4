life in the kitchen. +

Our users interact via CLI and GUI created with JavaFX. Written in Java, experience what many are enjoying.

== Summary of contributions (To be updated...)
* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to view recipes*
** What it does: Allows the user to list recipes via search and view the details of individual recipe.

** Justification: This is a core feature of the application which allow user to search and view recipes.

** Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing data structure of the application. As the existing data
structure only supports managing of single core data, the Model Component has to be revamp to take in different data
for multiple features to be implement in time to come. Since there are common functions such as add, delete, edit and
 search, this requires design of classes that are generic to reduce duplication in code.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
