== PROJECT: SSENISUB

image::Ui.png[width="600"]

== Overview

This project portfolio serves to document my contributions to SSENISUB, a CS2103 (Software Engineering)
project, as part of my Computer Science curriculum in National University of Singapore (NUS).

SSENISUB is a business management application which is used for managing employees' information within an organisation.
Its name is inspired from the word "business", and is simply a palindrome of it. It is morphed from the given
`addressbook-level4` application as its base. The user interacts with it mainly using a
Command Line Interface (CLI). In conjunction with the CLI, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is used to make it more
user-friendly, supported by coloured text and symbols. This application is written in Java with about 15 kLoC,
and its GUI is created with JavaFX, CSS and HTML.

My main responsibility in SSENISUB is to implement commands (`feedback` and `rate`) that a manager would want to have to support a continuous
review and tracking of his/her employees' performance throughout their time in the organisation. This is used to support
making informed management decisions.

I also played a key role in creating an identity for SSENISUB by designing an icon and making it the
face of the application.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=iamrence[[RepoSense for IamRENCE]]

* *Major enhancement 1*: added *the ability to give ratings to staff* stored inside the application
** What it does: Allows the user to update a rating of a staff to keep track of his/her performance in the organisation.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user is provided with a way to keep track of
his/her employees' performance, which is especially important during the *year-end performance review*. It potentially
affects how much bonus or credit is given to the staff in the organisation.
** Highlights: This enhancement looks similar to the add and edit command, but has to be made to *execute asynchronous* to
these commands. In future releases, where users of different levels of authorisation are allowed to use different commands,
this command would only be accessible to managers (or direct superiors). The reason is that they have the right to and are in
the best position to give any rating to their staff.

* *Major enhancement 2*: added *the ability to give feedback to staff* stored inside the application
** What it does: Allows the user to give professional feedback to staff in the organisation, so that the staff knows what he/she is
doing well in and to find out what areas of improvement he/she can engage in.
** Justification: This feature, like the rate command, improves the product to a large extent because a user is provided
with a way to inform his/her employees what to look out for in their performance so that they can improve themselves.
Coupled with the rate command, a manager can make *more informed reviews* of his/her employees' performance. At the same
time, employees can use the feedback assigned to them as *motivation* for continuous improvement, or as a *wake up call* for
any bad performance. This can *boost the organisation's productivity* as a whole.
** Highlights: Just like the rate command, the feedback command is *run non-parallel to the add and edit command* due to
future user authorisation implementations. Another highlight of this command is that users *cannot enter profanities*
(even if it is entered in leetspeak). Designing an efficient way to check for profanities proved to be a very tough task: Whether
to base the runtime on input length or the number of profanities to be rejected. A detailed analysis had to be done to make a choice.
