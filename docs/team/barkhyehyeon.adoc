code]]

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to manage ingredients*
** What it does: Allows the user to track the stock of ingredients, view recipe according to ingredient and check
shop amount.

** Justification: This is a practical feature which would enhance user experience of cooking preparation.

** Highlights: Rather than mere stock tracking, this feature contains functions providing cognitive
shortcut for users. Also, it enables proper integration between information related to ingredient and recipe.

* *Major enhancement*: restructured *entire logic component*
** Justification: This was necessary to enable integration across multiple features, while maintaining efficiency by
distinguishing shared processes and making use of general classes.
** Highlights: This enables both modularization and efficient integration of features.
