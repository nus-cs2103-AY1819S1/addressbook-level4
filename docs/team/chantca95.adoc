== PROJECT: InsuRen

---

== Overview

'Ren' in Mandarin translates to 'person' or 'people', and true to our name, this app is all about managing oneâ€™s network of clients in an organized, efficient and intuitive manner. InsuRen is geared to the needs of the modern Insurance salesman, but anyone whose business is their strong rapport with their clients will find this to be an indispensable tool.

== Summary of contributions
* *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=chantca95[Project Code Dashboard]
* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to import contacts from a CSV file*
** What it does: allows the user to import contacts into InsuRen from a previously appropriately-formatted Excel CSV file.
** Justification: This feature makes it convenient for users who want to populate their own InsuRen apps with existing lists of contacts. Rather than manually copying and adding contacts one by one into InsuRen, users can instead simply format their contact lists into a CSV as shown in the user guide, and import them into InsuRen in one go.
** Highlights: This enhancement uses a new *Command*, *ImportCommand*. Users can choose CSV files using a mouse and file browser, or if they are familiar with pathing formats on their respective Operating Systems, they can also enter the path (either relative and absolute) of the required CSV.
** Credits: none

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the ability to export InsuRen data into a CSV file*
** What it does: allows the user to export the current contacts in InsuRen into a new CSV file, whose name is given by the user.
** Justification: This feature allows for convenient movement of a user's contact list. Some usages include keeping a back up of one's contact list, allowing one to view his InsuRen data on mobile platforms, etc.
** Highlights: This enhancement uses a new *Command*, *ExportCommand*.
** Credits: http://javaonlineguide.net/2014/10/compare-two-files-in-java-example-code.html - code referenced for testing ExportCommand
