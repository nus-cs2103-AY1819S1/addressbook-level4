== Summary of contributions
* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=benntay[Functional
code]]
* *Major enhancement*: added the _Meal Planner feature_.
** What it does: Allows users to add their desired recipes to a Meal Planner so that they can plan their days' meals.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can not only browse recipes, but also keep a record of the recipes they want to try on which specific days.
** Highlights: This enhancement was originally unsupported by the AB4 code; it is a completely new component feature.

* *Major enhancement*: restructured and modularised UI component and implemented panel
switching between different features.
** Justification: This was to allow easy and efficient integration for the UI aspect
across multiple features through the use of general classes, as well as to allow
switching between the display panels of different features.
** Highlights: This enables both modularised and efficient integration of features into
UI and allowed easy switching between different feature panels through the use of
Universal Commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented cross-model deletion and clearing in order to maintain
data consistency across the different models.
** Justification: There are some scenarios to consider where modifying one model has to affect
one or more other models.
*** Recipe that is already planned in the Meal Planner is deleted from the recipe model. +
In this scenario, the deleted recipe will now also be removed from the days in the Meal
Planner where it was previously planned, and also from the day planned in the Health Planner.
*** 3 recipes that have been planned in a single day are deleted from the recipe model. +
In this scenario, the day in the Meal Planner which has had all its recipes removed will also
be deleted from the Meal Planner. This then cascades on to the Health Planner, and the deleted
day will be removed from any health plans where it was previously added to.
*** A day from the Meal Planner that has been added to a health plan in the Health Planner is deleted from
the Meal Planner. +
In this scenario, the deleted day will now also be removed from the health plans in the Health
Planner where it was previously added.
*** Clearing the Meal Planner while days have been added to health plans in the Health Planner. +
In this scenario, all the health plans in the Health Planner will now have all their previously
added days removed.
*** A recipe that is already planned in the Meal Planner is edited. +
In this scenario, the recipe's changes will now also be reflected in the Meal Planner and also
in the Health Planner if the day has been added to a health plan.
** Highlights: This ensures that the different types of data across the different models in
SousChef all remain in synchronization and logically correct.
