== PROJECT: WishBook

---

== Overview

WishBook (WB) is a piggy bank in a digital app form, made for people who need a user-friendly solution for keeping track
of their disposable income. Not only does WB keep records of your savings, it also allows users to set items as goals
for users to work towards, serving as a way to cultivate the habit of saving. WB is made for people who have material
wants in life, but are uncertain of purchasing said wants, by helping them to reserve disposable income so that they
know they can spend on their wants.

This project portfolio consists of the contributions I have made to WishBook over the semester. +

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to save towards a wish or remove an amount from a wish.*
** What it does: Allows the user to save a specified amount of money to a particular wish or remove a specified amount
from it. A wish will be fulfilled when the user saves up to 100% of a wish's price and excess amount cannot be saved
towards it any longer.
** Justification: This feature is a crucial feature in the WishBook as it cannot fulfill its primary requirement
without it.The fact that two actions, namely saving and removing can be done with a single command means that there are
less commands to remember.
** Highlights: This enhancement touches multiple components and required thorough consideration of alternative design.
Hence it is naturally my most time consuming contribution. Significant effort was also expended in modifying the tests
to test this new feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added *the ability to find wishes by name, tag and remark.*
** What it does: Allows a user to find a wish by its name, tag and remark with varying level of inclusiveness.
** Justification: The flexible design of this command allows user to specify varying number of arguments to the wish
which gives the user multiple ways to find a wish or a group of wishes for ease of access.
** Highlights: It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as
it required rewriting and adapting the code written for an existing command. Significant effort was also expended in
modifying the tests to test this new feature.

* *Minor enhancement*: Converted email attribute in a wish to date attribute which stores the due date of a wish. The
date cannot be earlier or equal to the current date.

* *Minor enhancement*: Made the wish list to be permanently sorted by due date regardless of the commands applied
on them.
** Highlights: Required modification of test data which led to modification of a significant number of tests.

* *Minor enhancement*: Made the wishes be identified only by a newly added attribute, UUID. This allows
for addition of wishes with the same attribute values, something which was not allowed previously. UUID of a wish also
cannot be changed upon addition of a wish.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a remark command.
