The purpose of this portfolio is to document my contributions to _Car Park Finder_, a software engineering team project to be completed as
part of the CS2103T Software Engineering module in National University of Singapore (NUS).

== Project: Car Park Finder

=== Overview

_Car Park Finder_ is a desktop command-line application for all car owners seeking a hassle-free way to find
Housing & Development Board (HDB) car parks in Singapore. +

Our application allows you to view vital information such as parking lots availability for each car park, so that you can
plan ahead of your trip.

If you use the computer frequently and commute by driving, why not try out
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T09-4/main/releases[_Car Park Finder_]. No installation is required and getting
started is as simple as typing out a text message.

Main Features of _Car Park Finder_:

* Find by location helps to narrows down the car parks near your destination
* Filter through the list of car parks with the use of flags to get the preferred choice of car park
* Receive notifications on how many parking lots are still available for a car park
* Use of autocomplete to simplify overcomplicated commands by prompting correct format

=== Summary of contributions

_This section is to provide a summary of my contributions to the project._

My main task for _Car Park Finder_ was to *query data* from the database and *update the information*
of all the HDB car parks.

This allows users of the application to:

* Find car parks based on their postal code, address or car park number
* Filter car parks using information like night parking as flags etc
* View and click on car parks in the Google Maps found inside _Car Park Finder_

'''

* *Major enhancement*: Query data to provide real-time updates
** What it does: This enhancement is broken down into two commands, namely `query` and `notify`. Basically both commands
retrieve data from the database and either add or update the car parks in _Car Park Finder_. Users will then be able to find and filter the
car parks base on their preferences and pick one that is most suitable for them.
** Justification: This feature is part of the core requirements for the application to work properly. Without it, users
would not be able to view all the HDB car parks in Singapore easily or receive notifications about them.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires an in-depth analysis of design alternatives as it is written from scratch.
It serves as a basis for other features and without it, there would not be any car park(s) data. This affects features
to be added in future, since a change in car park information could require changing the whole system. The implementation
too was challenging as it required threading to ensure a fast and efficient load time while querying the database.
** Credit: https://github.com/google/gson[Gson] library for converting JSON data from _data.gov.sg_ database to Java
Objects for use in the project. +

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Added marker clustering for the Google Maps to limit the number of markers on the map. It also
zooms in onto the location when clicked on.
*** Credit: This enhancement uses Javascript and was based off the https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/marker-clustering[tutorial here]
provided by Google.
** Updated the status bar to show the total number of car park(s) in _Car Park Finder_. I also added a check for List and
Clear commands to either show all the car park(s) or display a "no car parks(s) available" message instead of displaying zero.
