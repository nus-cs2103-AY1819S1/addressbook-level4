== Introduction

Makan Book is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app to search for restaurants within NUS to eat at alone or with friends*. More importantly, MakanBook is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). MakanBook also allows users to add and manage friends and groups, start private and public jios and so much more! Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `makanbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Makan Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
