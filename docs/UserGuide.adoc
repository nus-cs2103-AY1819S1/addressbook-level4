== Introduction

ThanePark is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing the rides in
your theme park!*. More importantly, ThanePark is *optimized for those who prefer
to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ThanePark can get your
contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump
to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `thanepark.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ThanePark.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`exit`* : exits the app
