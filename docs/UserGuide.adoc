== Introduction

U-Schedule is for university students who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their schedule*. More importantly, U-Schedule is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It features a calendar to manage regular events such as lectures and tutorials, as well as a todo list for upcoming deadlines. If you can type fast, you can manage both of these more efficiently with U-Schedule than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add event t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add event t/CS2103 Lecture`.
* Items in curly brackets denote the choices of words that can be used. e.g. `add {event/todo}`
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `t/TITLE [tag/TAG]` can be used as `t/CS2103 Lecture tag/lecture` or as `t/CS2103 Lecture`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/lecture`, `tag/cs2103` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION t/TITLE` is also acceptable.
* The second word specifies whether the command will operate on the todo list or the calendar. For example `add event` adds an event to the calendar and `add todo` will add an item to the todo list.
* Priorities on the todo list are either `H`, `M` or `L` for high, medium or low respectively, in upper case.

// end::features[]

=== Viewing help : `help`

Opens the User Guide in a new window.

Format: `help`

// tag::add[]
=== Adding: `add`

Adds a calendar event to the calendar +
Format: `add event t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION s/START_DATETIME e/END_DATETIME v/VENUE [tag/TAG]...` +
Adds an item to the todo list +
Format: `add todo t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION p/{H/M/L}`

****
* Adds the specified item to the calendar or todo list
* Since it is difficult to type a rigidly formatted date and time, a natural language date parser will try to parse the input for calendar events.
* The start and end datetimes can be word descriptions, such as 'the day after tomorrow', or '1 week from now'.
* If only a time is specified, the application will assume you mean today.
* The priority can be `H`, `M` or `L` for high, medium or low respectively, in upper case.
****

[TIP]
A calendar event can have any number of tags. (including 0)

Examples:

* `add event t/CS2103 Lecture d/Abstraction, IntelliJ, Gradle s/16 oct 2pm e/16 oct 4pm v/i3 Auditorium tag/lecture`
* `add todo t/CS2103 Assignment d/Version Control p/L`
// end::add[]

// tag::list[]
=== Listing: `list`

Shows the list of all calendar events / todo items in the calendar / todo list. +
Format: `list {event/todo}`
// end::list[]

// tag::edit[]
=== Editing: `edit`

Edits an existing calendar event in the calendar. +
Format: `edit event INDEX [t/TITLE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [s/START_DATETIME] [e/END_DATETIME] [v/VENUE] [tags/TAG]...` +

****
* Edits the calendar event / todo list item at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the calendar event will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the calendar event's tags by typing `tag/` without specifying any tags after it.
****

Examples:

* `edit event 1 d/Abstraction v/i3 Auditorium` +
Edits the description and venue of the calendar event to be `Abstraction ` and `i3 Auditorium` respectively.
* `edit event 2 t/CS2103 Project Meetup` +
Edits the name of the 2nd calendar event to be `CS2103 Project Meetup`.
// end::edit[]

// tag::find[]
=== Searching for events: `find event`

Finds calendar events whose title, venue or description match any of the given keywords.
Also optionally filters the search by the specified date & time interval as well as the specified tags. +
Format: `find event [KEYWORD MORE_KEYWORDS...] [from/DATE & TIME] [to/DATE & TIME] [tag/TAG] [tag/MORE_TAGS]...`

****
* Shows list of events that match the keywords and fulfil the filter rules.
* The most relevant results are shown at the top.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Fuzzy Keyword Search
** The search is *case insensitive* for both keywords. e.g `lecture` will match `Lecture`
** The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `CS2103 Lecture` will match `Lecture CS2103`
** The fuzzy search allows for *partial matches for keywords*. e.g. `2103 lec` will match `CS2103 Lecture`.
*** Slight differences and typos will also usually be matched. e.g. `s2130 Lecutre` will match 'CS2103 Lecture'
* Filter by Date & Time
** Shows events that occur in the interval from the `from` date & time, to the `to` date & time.
*** i.e. the event must be ongoing at some point in the time interval starting at the `from` date and ending at the `to` date
** You can choose to include only one of the 2 (`from` or `to`) date & times
** Date & time are parsed using Natural Language Parsing, thus they can be input in most human-readable formats, e.g. `16 nov 8am`
*** Note: sometimes date & time inputs may be parsed unexpectedly - see Question 3 in the <<FAQ,FAQ>>
* Filter by Tags
** In order for an event to be shown, it must have a tag that is *exactly matching* (although case-insensitive) with the input tag.
** If multiple tags are input, the filter will only show the events with ALL the input tags.

****

=== Using the Calendar Display

==== Manual navigation:

Navigating the calendar to viewing the events:

* kbd:[&larr;]: Display previous week
* kbd:[&rarr;]: Display next week
* kbd:[&darr;]: Scroll up to events earlier in the day
* kbd:[&uarr;]: Scroll down to events later in the day

[NOTE]
====
Scrolling with the mouse wheel is also possible.
====

[NOTE]
====
The calendar display must be in focus in order to navigate with the arrow keys.
====

==== Automatic Navigation:

When selecting an event, either by the `select` command or clicking in the list of calendar events,
the calendar display will navigate to that event and attempt to centralize it in the calendar.

==== Viewing Event Details

The compact display of the calendar does not allow all the information of the event to be displayed.
To view full details of an event, double click on it to open a dialog box containing the details of the event.
// end::calendar[]

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

Application data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

// tag::faq[]
== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous U-Schedule folder.

*Q*: Why is the calendar display not responding to the arrow keys? +
*A*: The calendar display must be in focus in order for it to receive the arrow key events. Try clicking on the calendar display. If a blue highlight is present around the edges, the calendar display is in focus and will now receive the key presses.

*Q*: The date time parser is parsing dates unexpectedly! +
*A*: The Natural Language Parser we used tries its best to parse a datetime out of any input. Hence, there are some inputs which even humans would not consider a valid date, but the parser would still try to find a best fit. Most of the time, if a human can understand the input, the parser will parse the input correctly.
