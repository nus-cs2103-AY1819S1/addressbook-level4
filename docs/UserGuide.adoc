== Introduction

Student Schedule Planner (SSP) is a desktop application *aimed at helping students manage their schedules effectively*. SSP is *optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SSP can get your schedule management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
