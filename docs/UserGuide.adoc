=== Patient Record Management

// tag::patientfirsthalf[]

[TIP]
.Pro tip(s):
====
* A patient can have any number of tags (including 0).
* Mandatory parameters can be keyed in any order.
====

[WARNING]
.Important:
Omission of *any* mandatory parameters will result in the failure of adding the patient to the database.

Upon successful execution, you should see the patient with his details added to the patient list on the right.

Examples:

* `add n/Clinton Law ic/S9638902L p/97947435 e/clinton@cs2103t.com a/Tembusu College` +
Adds a patient named `Clinton Law`, with IC number `S9638902L`, phone number `97947435`, email `clinton@cs2103t.com` and address of `Tembusu College` to CLInic's patient database, as shown below.

* At least one of the optional parameters must be provided.
* Existing values will be *overwritten* by the newly input values of the corresponding field.
* You cannot edit the record of a patient that is currently in queue.
====

[TIP]
.Pro tip(s):
You can remove *all* of a patient's tags by typing the `t/` prefix without specifying any tags.

====
* The search is case insensitive.
** `Bryan` will match `bryaN`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter.
