speed is the only pre-requisite required to reap its numerous benefits, which includes:

* Easy management of large databases of patient and medicine information
* Efficient generation of official documents including receipts and medical certificates
* Ease of use through helpful graphical displays of obscure technical information
* User friendly commands that make complicated tasks intuitive
* Packaged with an elegant queue system that displays the real-time states of the separate queues in the clinic
for staff and patients to see

If you wish for a clinic management application that can radically enhance your productivity, then look no further

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user +
** in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in kbd:[[]*square brackets* kbd:[]] are optional +
** `[b/BLOOD_TYPE] [da/DRUG_ALLERGY]` can be used as `b/A+ da/Panadol` or as `b/A+`.

=== Patient Record Management

// tag::patientfirsthalf[]
==== Adding a patient: `add`
Did someone just walk in, wanting to see the doctor? +
Add him to CLInic's patient database using the `add` command! +
Alias: `a` +
Format: `add n/NAME ic/IC_NUMBER p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
.Pro tip(s):
====
* A patient can have any number of tags (including 0).
* Mandatory parameters can be keyed in any order.
====

[WARNING]
.Important:
Omission of *any* mandatory parameters will result in the failure of adding the patient to the database.

Upon successful execution, you should see the patient with his details added to the patient list on the left.

Examples:

* `add n/Clinton Law ic/S9638902L p/97947435 e/clinton@cs2103t.com a/Tembusu College` +
Adds a patient named `Clinton Law`, with IC number `S9638902L`, phone number `97947435`, email `clinton@cs2103t.com` and address of `Tembusu College` to CLInic's patient database, as shown below.

.After executing the `add` command specified above *and* left clicking `Clinton's` patient card in the patient list on the left, indicated by the black cursor.
image::AddEx1.png[width="900"]

==== Editing a patient: `edit`
Uhoh! Made a mistake keying in a patient's particulars? Or perhaps a patient had recently changed his address? +
Fret not! Simply update his particulars using the `edit` command! +
Alias: `e` +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

[NOTE]
.Thing(s) to note:
====
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list. It must be a *non zero, positive integer* (eg. 1, 2, 3...)!
* At least one of the optional parameters must be provided.
* Existing values will be *overwritten* by the newly input values of the corresponding field.
* You cannot edit the record of a patient that is currently in the queue.
====

[TIP]
.Pro tip(s):
You can remove *all* of a patient's tags by typing the `t/` prefix without specifying any tags.

Upon successful execution, you should see the patient's details updated in the patient list on the left.

Examples:

* `edit 5 p/98534228 e/clawyq@cs2101.com` +
Updates the phone number and e-mail address of the 5^th^ patient in the list to `98534228` and `clawyq@cs2101.com` respectively, as shown below.

[NOTE]
.Thing(s) to note:
====
* Only the patient's name is considered in the search. Patients whose name contains at least one of the given keywords will be returned.
** `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.
* Only full words will be matched. This is to prevent too general keywords from fetching too many results, thus making `find` ineffective.
** `Han` will not match `Hans`.
====

[TIP]
.Pro tip(s):
====
* The search is case insensitive.
** `Bryan` will match `bryaN`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter.
====

Upon successful execution, you should only see all the patients who have the specified keyword in their names in the patient list on the right.

Examples:

* `f yu` +
Sieves out all the patients who have `yu` in their names.

====
* Updates the medical records of a patient based on the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list. The index *must be a positive integer* (i.e. 1, 2, 3, ...).
* At least one of the optional parameters must be provided.
* Newly input values will be appended to the existing values of the patient, except `BloodType`. `BloodType` cannot be changed, you can only add `BloodType` to a patient once, and it will be permanent.
