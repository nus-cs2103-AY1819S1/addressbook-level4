== Introduction

EventOrganiser is an application for managing and organising events built for NUS students, also known as Event Organiser.
More importantly, EventOrganiser is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, EventOrganiser can help you to arrange events faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `eventorganiser.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your EventOrganiser.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`listUser`* : lists all users in the Event Organiser
* **`addUser`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com pass/password a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : creates new user named `John Doe` to the Event Organiser.
* **`addEvent`**`n/CS2103 Project Meeting a/SoC Canteen t/Urgent` : adds an event named CS2103 Project Meeting to be held at SoC Canteen.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

// tag::InBrief[]
== How it works, in brief

* To use the application, you must first create an account using the `addUser` command, and then `login`.
* If you are not yet logged in, you can still view event details using `selectEvent`, and find events using `findEvent` and `findEventByTime`, and list events using `listEvent`.
* Without logging in, you can also use the `selectUser`, `findUser`, `listUser`, `listFriends`, `suggestFriendsByInterests` commands.
* When you are done, simply `logout` or `exit` the application.

=== Organise an event
* If you are looking to organise an event, you may do so using the `addEvent` command.
* After creating the event, you may wish to specify the date, time, or specify only after participants have joined.
* You may create polls to get participants to vote on the details of the event using `addPoll` and `addPollOption`.
* You can create a special TimePoll using `addTimePoll` after all participants have joined to decide on a suitable time. This generates poll options based on the NUS timetables/schedules of the participants.
* You may decide to `deleteEvent` after the event is over, or leave it in the organiser as a form of record.

=== Join an event
* If you are looking to join an event as a participant, you may search for an event to join using the `findEvent` and `findEventByTime` commands.
* You can also search for other users using the `findUser` and `listFriends` commands to see what events they have joined and join that event as well.
* After joining the event using `joinEvent`, you can vote in the polls by displaying the poll details using `displayPoll`.
* You can then add options using `addOption`, or simply vote for an option using `vote`.
// end::InBrief[]

=== Manage your account
* After setting up your account, you can edit your own details using the `editUser` command, and delete your own account using `deleteUser`.
* You can also search for other users using `suggestFriendsByInterests` and add them as your friend using `addFriend`, or remove them as a friend using `deleteFriend`.
* You can populate your schedule using an NUSMODs link, and also manually add time slots into your schedule.

// tag::scheduletimetable[]
== Special Considerations

=== XML file

* We store all of the EventOrganiser data under data/addressbook.xml
* This file is to be stored securely on the computer. No user is allowed to read or edit the xml file using a text editor.

=== User Uniqueness

* We define the uniqueness of a user by its tuple of NAME and PASSWORD. No two users can have the same NAME and PASSWORD pair. If two users have the same name, then they will have to use different passwords.
* As user/password pair may allow for a brute-force password attack, we urge all users to choose a secure password that is not easily guessed or commonly used by others.

=== Event Uniqueness

* We define the uniqueness of an event by the event name, location, tags and event organiser. No two events may be identical with respect to these four attributes.

=== Timetable
Timetable download guide

To be referenced by any commands that use `tt/` prefix.
Format `Command tt/ http://modsn.us/XXXX...`

Example: +
* http://modsn.us/eDmp1 +
* http://modsn.us/H4v8s

****
* Two possible error messages may be returned by the download, namely A - "Cannot retrieve NUSMODS module information" and B - "Invalid NUSMODS URL".
* Note that the timetable download may take a while regardless if the link is valid or not.
* Only the current semester timetable will be downloaded. Other semesters timetable will not be downloaded.
* In the case of slow internet speeds or no internet, the download will return with either A or B. Please try again with a better internet connection as we are not able to control such factors.
* If the link given is not a http link such as fakelink, hscp:// or any other random string, the download will return A.
* If the link given is a modsn.com link but it does not link to a valid timetable, the download will return B.
* If the link given is a modsn.com link with a valid timetable but it is an empty timetable, the download will return properly with the empty timetable.
****

Warning: Timetable download will overwrite any existing schedule in the user.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Dates are all specified in `dd-MM-yyyy` format (e.g. `01-01-2019`, and Times are all specified in 24-hr `HH:mm` format (e.g. `13:30` is 1pm).

=== View help : `help`

Shows all the commands in the application and how to use them.

=== User Commands

==== Add a user : `addUser`

Adds a new uniqiue user to EventOrganiser. +
Format: `addUser n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL pass/password a/ADDRESS [i/INTEREST]... [tt/TIMETABLE] [t/TAG]...`

****
* INTEREST refers to the things that the user is interested in, such as hobbies.
* TAG refers to a group that the user is affiliated with, such as faculty name or class number.
* A user can have any number of tags and interests (including 0).
* Interests and tags must be alphanumeric.

* <<Timetable>> download requires a valid nusmods link.
* <<User Uniqueness>> property must be satisified.
****

Examples:

****
* Prefixes (e.g. "n/", "p/", "e/", "a/", "i/", "t/") of the attributes that they want to search for must be included.
* Any combination of the above prefixes and keywords (let's call them conditions for now) is valid. Eg. `findUser e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS` searches based on the email and address conditions.
* The order of the conditions does not matter.
* The search is based on CONDITION 1 AND CONDITION 2 AND ... . For example, `findUser n/John i/dance` will search for users that satisfy the conditions of both name 'John' and interest 'dance'. Likewise for attributes that can be stated more than one (interest and tag), `findUser i/tennis i/soccer` will search for users that satisfy the conditions of both interest 'tennis' and interest 'soccer'.
* The search for all attributes is not case sensitive. For example, `findUser n/john` will search for all users with the name 'John'.
* Substrings or superstrings of any attribute will not be matched e.g. phone number `87438807` will not match `874388070`, and likewise, name `Ale` will not match `Alex`.

* When editing interests/tags, the existing interests/tags of the user will be removed (adding of tags is not cumulative). Hence if you want to add new interests/tags on top of the existing ones, you have to include the existing ones in the edit command.
* Due to what is mentioned above, you can remove all the user's interests/tags by typing `i/` or `t/` without specifying any interests/tags after it.
* Note schedule-related parameters are applied in this order: TIMETABLE, SCHEDULE_UPDATE
* After the user is edited (eg change of name), if the edited user is in the friend list of another user, the other user's friend list will be updated to show the updated version of the edited user.
* When using schedule update, the parameter should be "day 0000" where day is the day of the week and 0000 is the 24h representation of the time. Note that schedule only records in 30 min slots, thus the minute value will be rounded off to the nearest 30 minutes.
