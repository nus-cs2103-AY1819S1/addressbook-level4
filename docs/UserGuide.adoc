== Introduction

TutorPal is for private tutors who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing students information*. More importantly, TutorPal is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). TutorPal is a great tool to track students' academic performance and schedule. Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `Tutor Pal.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Tutor Pal.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 el/Primary 4 g/Y1819S1_Mid 89 t/friends t/owesMoney` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*


* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items,Grades in square brackets are optional. +
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items,Grades with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times or grades), `t/friend`, `g/midterm 100`, `t/friend t/family`, `g/test1 100 g/test2 99` etc.
* Grade consists of two parts, exam name and exam score.
** The name and score should be separated by space.
** Score should be between 0 and 100.
** Considering the grades are just some records, the APP didn't implement the delete function temporarily. If you input a wrong exam name, use undo to fix it.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a person: `add`


Adds a person to the student list +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS el/EDUCATIONAL_LEVEL [g/GRADE]... [t/TAG]...`

****
* If the student added has exactly the same name as an existing student in the student list, new student cannot be added.
* `EDUCATIONAL_LEVEL` must be `Primary`, `Secondary` or `JC`. +
e.g. `... el/Primary ...` is valid; however, `... el/primary ...`, `... el/University ...` or other inputs like these are invalid
* The format of `GRADE` is `exam name` + `exam score`. +
e.g. `... g/mid-test 100 ...`
****


[TIP]
====
* A person can have any number of tags and grades (including 0).
* Name of the exam should be different. Otherwise, they will be considered as the same one and the APP will store the score of the last one.
====

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 el/Primary 4 g/Y1819S1_Final 100 g/Y1819S1_Mid 89 t/friends t/owesMoney`

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [el/EDUCATIONAL_LEVEL] [g/GRADE] [t/TAG]...`

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed. +
i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* Edit grade will not delete the previous grades as the tap attribute. If the exam name exists already, it will cover the previous one and edit the score only.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/alex@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `alex@example.com` respectively.

****

Examples:

* `exchangeTime Alice 0 Bob 0`
Exchange Alice first time slot and Bob first time slot.

[NOTE]
====
The reason this command exists is that when two student want to swap time
it cannot only use edit because the existing time-slot will crush.

If the two students are not in the same grade of same education level
It will be considered as invalid command.

The ordinal number of the time is 0 base.
If the the corresponding time-slot doesn't exit based on the ordinal number, then return invalid input.

e.g `cLeMenTi` is same as `Clementi`, and `cLeMenTi` can also be used to find person `John Doe` whose address is `311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25`
* The search allows fuzzy matching on long keywords (long keyword means the keyword whose length is greater than 3). +
e.g. `clenti` will be fuzzy matched with `Clementi`, and will find the person `John Doe` whose address is `311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25`
* The search will not support fuzzy matching when the keywords are too short (≤ 3) or contain numbers. +
e.g. `Clementi Avo` does not match `Clementi Ave` because keyword `Avo` is short and will not be allowed to use fuzzy matching, therefore, no person will be found
* The order of the keywords does not matter. +
e.g. `Ave Clementi 2, 311, #02-25` will match `311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25`, and will find the person `John Doe` whose address is `311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25`
