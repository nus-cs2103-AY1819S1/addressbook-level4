== Introduction

TutorPal is for private tutors who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing students information*. More importantly, TutorPal is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). TutorPal is a great tool to track students' academic performance and schedule. Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

* The search will not support fuzzy matching when the keywords are too short (≤ 3) or contain numbers. +
e.g. `Clementi Avo` does not match `Clementi Ave` because keyword `Avo` is short and will not be allowed to use fuzzy matching, therefore, no person will be found
* The order of the keywords does not matter. +
e.g. `Ave Clementi 2, 311, #02-25` will match `311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25`, and will find the person `John Doe` whose address is `311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25`
