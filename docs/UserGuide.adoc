== Introduction
WishBook (WB) is a piggy bank in a digital app form, made for people who need a user-friendly solution for keeping track of their disposable income. Not only does WB keep records of your savings, it also allows users to set items as goals for users to work towards, serving as a way to cultivate the habit of saving. WB is made for people who have material wants in life, but are uncertain of purchasing said wants, by helping them to reserve disposable income so that they know they can spend on their wants. So what are you waiting for? Go to Section 2, <<Quick Start>> and start saving!

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g. in `save AMOUNT [INDEX]`, `INDEX` is an optional parameter, since the save command can be used as `save 40`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/broke`, `t/needs` etc.
* The `/` symbol between parameters means that you can use either of the parameters types in the command e.g. in `add WISH PRICE [TIME_GIVEN]/[START_DATE to END_DATE]`, you provide either the `TIME_GIVEN` parameter or `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` parameters.
