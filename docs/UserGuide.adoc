From recipe recommendations just for you, to meal planning and inventory management,
Sous Chef has everything you need to improve life in the kitchen.
The application works with a *Command Line Interface (CLI) for speedy*
provision of recipe choices, management of your cooking plan while guiding you through
the preparation process.
With a few commands, this kitchen helper will be
there to keep cooking as simple as ABC. Get started with <<Quick Start>> and

== Features
In Sous Chef, there are 2 types of command: universal commands and context-unique commands. +
 +
The universal commands can be used throughout the application and perform application-wide action. You can identify a
 universal command from its "-" convention followed by a keyword (e.g. -exit). +
 +
 The context-unique commands on the other hand are only valid for that context. (e.g. <<Recipes Commands (Only applicable in recipe context)>> can only be
 used in -recipe context). These commands contains only a action key word followed by the required parameters, if any. (e.g. select INDEX)

====
*Command Format Convention*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME c/COOKTIME d/DIFFICULTY [t/TAG]`,
`NAME`, `COOKTIME` and `DIFFICULTY` and `TAG` are parameters are to be replaced: `add n/Fried Chicken d/2 c/20M
t/Fastfood`.
* Items in square brackets are optional (i.e. can be omitted).
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used 1 or more: `t/Japanese`, `t/Halal t/Seafood` etc. With `[]` it can also be omitted totally too.
