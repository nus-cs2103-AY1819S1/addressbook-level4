== Introduction

CAPTracker is a desktop app that allows NUS students to track their current CAP (Cumulative Average Point), set a CAP goal, and calculate target grades needed to achieve their goal.+
CAPTracker is optimized for users who are familiar with CLI (Command Line Interface) for input control while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for displaying information.+
If you can type fast, CAPTracker is the ideal application for monitoring your current CAP, and predicting grades needed to achieve your ideal CAP for modules that hasn't been taken. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `10` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `captracker.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you would want to use as the home folder for
your CAP Tracker.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few
seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. Typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some commands you can try:

* `add -m CS2103 -y 2 -s 1 -c 4 -g A+` : Adds a module `CS2103` worth
`4` MCs taken in Semester `1` as a Year `2` student.
* **`goal 4.5`** : Sets a CAP goal of 4.5.
* **`delete -t CS2103 -e 2 -z 1` : Deletes `CS2103` taken in year `2` semester
* `delete -t CS2103 -e 2 -z 1` : Deletes `CS2103` taken in year `2` semester
`1` from CAPTracker.
* *`exit`* : Exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

//tag::featureoverview[]

=== Feature overview
In the CAPTracker app, you can add modules that you've completed and it will display your current CAP.  A module consists of a code, year, semester, number of credits, and an associated grade. +
You may also add incomplete modules (i.e. modules that you are currently enrolled in, or plan to enroll in eventually, but you have not received your grade yet) simply by adding that module and omitting the grade.+
You may also set a CAP goal, and the app will automatically generate the target grades necessary for your incomplete modules so that you can achieve your goal. The app will also let you know if your goal is too high based on the number of incomplete credits you have and your current CAP. +
Lastly, you can also adjust the target grade of a particular incomplete module (for example, a module you know you can get an A in) and the app will automatically recalculate the required grades for the rest of the modules (so you can afford to score lower on those modules). +
Happy tracking!

//tag::commandgoal[]
=== Setting Cap Goal : `goal`

Set the CAP goal you want to achieve. +

****
* Sets and updates the CAP goal.
****

Examples:

* `goal 4.5` +
Update your CAP goal to 4.5
//end::commandgoal[]

=== Adjusting target goals: `adjust`

[NOTE]
Removal of adjustment will be made available in v1.5.

Adjust the grade of an incomplete module +
Format:

* *Module code is unique*: `adjust MODULE_CODE GRADE`
* *Otherwise*: `adjust MODULE_CODE YEAR SEM GRADE`

Examples:

* `adjust CS2103 A` +
Adjusts the grade with module code CS2103 to have grade A

* `adjust CS2103 1 1 A` +

//end::commandadjust[]

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

//tag::savingdata[]

=== Saving your module data
Your module information and CAP goal are automatically saved on the hard disk as a JSON file (by default `data/transcript.json`) whenever there are changes to the modules or CAP goal. The data is automatically loaded into the app again upon startup.+
You may manually change the location to store your data by changing the value of `transcriptFilePath` in the file `data/preferences.json` (found in the same directory as the CapTracker jar file). +
You may load your module data in the CAPTracker app on another computer or share it with other users if desired, simply by sharing the module data file generated by your instance of the app. The value of `transcriptFilePath` in the preferences file will have to be changed to the location of your own data file.
Note: Do not modify the JSON module data file manually, or you may lose your data.
//end::savingdata[]

=== Understanding the User Interface
Understanding the User Interface can be tricky - what do all the different colours mean? How do I
know what has been saved or not? Where can I see new modules I've added?

* To view new modules you've added, scroll down to the bottom of the pannel that you have categorized your
module under; either the 'Completed Modules' panel on the left, or the 'Incomplete Modules' panel on the
right. Your new entry should be at the bottom of these lists.

* Understanding the colours. The grades of modules in the 'Completed Modules' panel on the left
are circled in GREEN. This indicates that this particular module has already been taken and this is
a grade that the user does not need to worry about; it is in the past.
The grades in the the 'Incomplete Modules' panel on the right  are circled in RED. This indicates
that this particular module has not been taken and that the grade displayed in this RED circle is
not certain. It is a grade that the user needs to be aware of as it's outcome will impact the
users overall CAP score.

== FAQ

*Q*: I entered the wrong grade into my module. How do I change it? +
*A*: Use the `edit` command to input the correct information for the module +
`edit -t MODULE_CODE -g ACTUAL_GRADE`
//tag::ambersFAQ[]
*Q*: I entered the year I took my module, 2018, and it doesn't work. Why not?

*A*: The year of the module in CAPTracker doesn't refer to the calander year, but
instead the year that you are studying at. For example, a module taken in your
second year of study would have a year value of 2.


*Q*: I entered a new module but can't see it in the app. Where is it?

*A*: New modules you have added will appear at the bottom of the list in either
the 'Completed Modules' list or the 'Incomplete Modules' list depending on your
specification. Scroll down to the bottom of these lists to find your new module;
it may not appear without you scrolling if there are already a number of mdoules
entered!


*Q*: Why does my CAP goal say 'Impossible'?

*A*: Whether or not the users CAP goal is achievable is based on the grades of
completed modules and the number of incomplete modules the user has entered. If
the completed modules do not have sufficient grades to meet the CAP goal, try to
add some modules you are planning to take; it may be that you need an A+ is four
other modules before your CAP goal can be achieved. It is also based on the
adjustments made by the user. For example, if the user originally enters


*Q*: I made the wrong adjustment to a module...how do I remove the adjustment
I made?

*A*: To remove an incorrect adjustment, you need to delete that module (see
delete command chapter 3.4) and add it back in with the desired/correct
adjustments. A direct solution will be implemented in v2.0
