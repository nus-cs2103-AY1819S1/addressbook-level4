== Introduction


HealthBase is for hospital administrators, doctors, nurses, and pharmacists who prefer to use a desktop app to manage patients and their associated data.
More importantly, HealthBase is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, HealthBase can get your hospital management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure that your computer has Java version `9` or later installed.
.  Download the latest release of our application, `healthbase.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your HealthBase.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) should appear in a few seconds.
+
.The GUI of HealthBase

+
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
(The command box is shown in Fig. 1 above; it is the gray box with the words "Enter your commands here..." inside.)

Some example commands you can try:

* *`exit`* : exits the app
* *`select 1`* : selects the first patient (Alex Yeoh in the image above) in the list of patients.

Refer to <<Features>> for the details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [da/DRUG ALLERGY]` can be used as `da/aspirin da/insulin` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[da/DRUG ALLERGY]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `da/aspirin`, `da/aspirin da/insulin` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

TIP: Features are sorted by their command word in lexicographical order.

//tag::addappt[]
=== Add appointment for patient: `addappt`
Add a scheduled appointment for a patient.

Format: `addappt ic/NRIC type/TYPE pn/PROCEDURE_NAME dt/DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM doc/DOCTOR-IN-CHARGE`

[NOTE]
The only valid types are `PROP` (PROPAEDEUTIC), `DIAG` (DIAGNOSTIC), `THP` (THERAPEUTIC), `SRG` (SURGICAL).
*Other inputs are not allowed.*

[NOTE]
It is useful to note that HealthBase does not permit appointments of duplicate date and time for any one patient. This is
to prevent appointment clashes.

[WARNING]
The HealthBase System assumes that there are `31` days for all months. For the inputs of the dates `31` and `29` (for February), it is the onus of the user to ensure that
the input month has `31` days (for months except February) and `29` days for February in a leap year.

Example(s):

* `addappt ic/S1234567A type/SRG pn/Heart Bypass dt/27-04-2019 10:30 doc/Dr. Pepper`

[#img-addapptcommand]
. Type the example command into the input box as shown in the figure below and hit the kbd:[Enter] key:

.Adding an appointment for patient
image::addapptcommand.png[width="1000"]

[#img-addapptresult]
[start=2]
. The resulting output will be as shown in the figure below:

.Appointment has been added
image::addapptresult.png[width="1000"]

****
TIP: If you want to view the newly added appointments for a particular patient, simply enter `view appt`.
You may have to enter select `<patient index>` or click on the patient panel card.
To use the full capabilities of the `view` command, click <<#view-command, here>>.

//end::addappt[]

//tag::adddiet[]
=== Add patient’s dietary needs: `adddiet`
Add a patient’s dietary requirements into the system.

Format: `adddiet ic/NRIC alg/ALLERGY1 alg/ALLERGY2 cr/CULTURAL_REQUIREMENT pd/PHYSICAL_DIFFICULTY`

There are three types of dietary requirements, which can be added to a patient with their own prefixes:

|=====================================================
| Type of dietary requirement | Prefix | Usage Example
| Allergy | `alg` | `alg/Egg`
| Cultural Requirement | `cr` | `cr/Halal`
| Physical Difficulty | `pd` | `pd/Hands cannot move`
|=====================================================

****
NOTE: The number of dietary requirements in an `adddiet` command must adhere to the following rules:

* All three types are optional to be included, but there must be at least one dietary requirement in the command.
* For each type, more than one requirements can be specified in the command.
****

****
WARNING: The following inputs are considered as invalid when entering a dietary requirement:

* Input with non-alphabetical characters. Eg. `alg/1Egg`
* Input with only empty whitespaces or blank input. Eg. `cr/        pd/`
****

****
TIP: Adding two same dietary requirements to a patient will only result in one copy of the requirements being saved to
the patient.
****

Example(s):

* `adddiet ic/S1234567A alg/Egg alg/Crab cr/Halal pd/Hands cannot move`
* `adddiet ic/S1234567A cr/Vegetarian`

[#img-adddietcommand]

 Such an example can be seen in the figure below.

2. Submit the input into HealthBase by pressing kbd:[Enter].
The result display panel will show a successful `addmh` command message, and should show the further figure below.

****
WARNING: The following invalid inputs will result in a command failure, and the display of an appropriate error message.

* Incorrect format of the doctor's name.
** Doctor's title must be included.
** The first letter of all words in doctor's name must be captalised.
* Blank diagnosis
** An empty diagnosis will not be accepted as a valid diagnosis.

//tag::checkin[]
=== Check in a returning patient: `checkin`
Check in a returning patient back to the HealthBase system, and retrieve his/her information from backend and display
them in the left panel of the application window. The patient being checked in must have been previously registered
to the system and were checked out of the system sometime before by using the `checkout` command.

Format: `checkin ic/NRIC`

****
TIP: If there is no record of this patient in our system (which means that the patient with the specified `NRIC` has
not visited the hospital and not been registered in the system, the application will direct the user to use the `register` command
to register this new patient with his/her necessary information.
****

****
WARNING: If the patient with the specified `NRIC` is still active in the system (which means that the patient in the system has
not been checked out yet), the command is considered as invalid. +
The `checkin` command is only considered valid when the patient with the `NRIC` specified were checked out before
by using the `checkout` command.
****

Example(s):

* `checkin ic/S1234567A` +

****

****
WARNING: After a patient has been checked out from the system, all commands with the NRIC of this patient as parameter
(except the `checkin` command) will be considered as invalid commands.

=== Sort user view : `sort`
Sort the current view, if it is sortable.

Format: `sort SORT_TYPE SORT_ORDER`

`SORT_TYPE` refers to the order in which the sorting should be done (ascending, descending).
It can be either 'a' for ascending, or 'd' for descending.

`SORT_ORDER` refers to the order in which the sorting should be done.
How this affects the sorting exactly depends on each view, and will be explained in greater detail below.

|=======================================================================
| View Name | Sortable? | What `SORT_ORDER` refers to
| Default | No | -
| Apppointment | Yes | The columns of the table in the view, one-indexed.
| Diet | No | -
| Medication | Yes | The columns of the table in the view, one-indexed.
| Medical History | Yes | The columns of the table in the view, one-indexed.
|=======================================================================

Example(s):

* `sort a 123` where the current view is Medication
** Sorts the table in the medication view by the first column (Drug Name). Any entries with the same drug name will be further sorted by the second column (Dosage), with any entries with the same drug name and dosage being further sorted by the third column (Dosage Unit).
* `sort a 1` where the current view is the default view (blank view).
** Does nothing (the current view is not sortable).

[#view-command]
=== View patient’s information: `view`

* default (This is the default blank view, which is displayed when the application is started)
* appt (Appointment view, contains patient's appointments)
* diets (Diet view, contains patient's dietary requirements)
* meds (Medication view, contains information about the patient's medications)
* mh (Medical history view, contains patient's previous medical diagnoses)

This command switches the user's view (right panel of the UI, indicated in the figure directly below) to a chosen view. +
