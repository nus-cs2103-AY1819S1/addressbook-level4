== Introduction

Welcome to ThanePark!
ThanePark is a theme park management application that assists theme park managers and operators in obtaining ride information readily.
Using the keyboard, you can easily access features such as creating rides, updating ride information, finding rides with short waiting time and more.

Get started now by heading over to <<Quick Start>>. Enjoy!

== About

This user guide introduces you to ThanePark, provides detailed instructions to set up and gives you an overview of the available features.
No prior technical knowledge is required to use ThanePark.

For frequently asked questions, check out <<FAQ>>.

For a brief summary of all features, check out <<Command Summary>>.

== Quick Start

Steps to set up ThanePark:

.  Check that you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `thanepark.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].

If you left click on the any ride in the list, it will show the ride information in a window
similar to below:

image::Ui.png[width="800"]

[TIP]
The bar at the top of the window allows you to access `Help` or `About`. The `About` option on the navigation bar opens an About Us window.

[WARNING]
You will not be able to customise the image for rides. This feature will only be implemented in `v2.0`. +
Additionally, note that you may not enter more than 250 characters inside the `CommandBox`.
Any character past the 250th will be forcefully truncated. This is to guard against abuse. +
Also note that the waiting time and maintenance dates are not live, they are static and require manual updates.
Maintenance dates will update only when a command is executed. Maintenance dates do not update when ThanePark is restarted.
In v2.0 this updating process will be automated.


Congratulations! You have successfully set up ThanePark!

Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help more`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

Type some of these commands to try out ThanePark:

* *`viewall`* : lists all rides in your theme park.

* *`exit`* : exits the app.

Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

.Before executing `viewstatus open`
image::./ui_screenshots/viewstatus-example-1.png[width="550"]

In the diagram above, note that the list of rides in the red box at the left contains rides with different statuses.

.After executing `viewstatus open`
image::./ui_screenshots/viewstatus-example-2.png[width="550"]

As seen in the diagram above, once `viewstatus open` is executed, the list of rides in the box at the left only contains rides that are open.
In addition, the response box at the top of the diagram displays the total number of rides that are open.

Example 2: `viewstatus MainTenaNce`

`viewstatus MainTenaNce` command accepts inputs with mixed cases in the status field.

.Before executing `viewstatus MainTenaNce` command
image::./ui_screenshots/viewstatus-example-3.png[width="550"]

.After executing `viewstatus MainTenaNce` command
image::./ui_screenshots/viewstatus-example-4.png[width="550"]

Format: `viewall`

|===

=== Find the relevant list of rides

This section contains all commands related to finding rides that you need at any time.

Here are some examples with images to let you follow along. +
|===
a|
Examples:

[NOTE]
You can only use `find` to look for a full word in the name. This means a part of the name like "accel" will not work
and only the full name like "accelerator" will work.

The list of results should be like this if no changes were made to the application (ie. delete or add or update): +

image::./ui_screenshots/find-example-1.png[width="600"]

* `find z/ sci-fi` +
Finds and displays the list of attractions with zones that contain the word "sci-fi".

Display all rides that fits the condition in a list. It can only filter conditions that have numeric values i.e.
`Maintenance` and `WaitTime`. +

Format: `filter <tag> <condition> [[tag] [condition]...]` +
Can include more conditions as desired. +

|===
a|
Examples:

* `filter w/ < 10` +
Filters attractions with waiting time less than 10 minutes.
The list of results should like this if no changes were made to the application (ie. delete or add or update): +

image::./ui_screenshots/filter-example-1.png[width="600"]

* `filter w/ < 10 m/ >= 50` +
Filters attractions with waiting time less than 10 and maintenance of more than equals 50 days.
The list of results should look like this:

image::./ui_screenshots/filter-example-2.png[width="600"]
|===

[NOTE]
If a ride is selected, a `find` or `filter` is performed, the ride panel will still show the ride that was previously
selected. Future versions will automatically select the first ride on the list and allow you to see information about it
on the `BrowserPanel` or show the short help menu if no rides are found.
