== Introduction

MeetingBook is for those who prefer to use a desktop app to manage their meetings for university. MeetingBook is *designed for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users who can type fast can navigate and use the meeting planner faster than traditional GUI apps. Makes your hand itchy and want to try out? Go to <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your computer.
.  Download the latest `meetingbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your MeetingBook.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : Display all existing members on the display.
* **`addMember`**`n/<name> p/<phone> e/<email> a/<address>` : adds a member with the parameters specified to the MeetingBook.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd person shown in the current person list.

=== Find a group / person / meeting: `find`

The `find` command searches the MeetingBook for specified person, group, or meeting, and displays the results on
the panel. +

Syntax: +
 Longhand: `find [person|group|meeting]  *[all]/<keywords> *[some]/<keywords> *[none]/<keywords>` +
 Shorthand: `find [p|g|m] *[a]/<keyword...> *[s]/<keywords> *[n]/<keywords>` +

* `[person|group|meeting]`, `[p|g|m]`: This parameter specifies whether to search for persons, groups, or meetings.
    This parameter is required to execute this command.
    ** `person`, `p`: Specifies to search for persons.
    ** `group`, `g`: Specifies to search for groups.
    ** `meeting`, `m`: Specifies to search for meetings.
* `<keywords>`: This tag contains any number of keywords separated by a kbd:[space].
* `[all]`, `[a]`: This parameter specifies that the results must contain every keyword specified in `<keywords>`.
    This parameter may be omitted.
* `[some]`, `[s]`: This parameter specifies that the results must contain at least one keyword specified in `<keywords>`.
    This parameter may be omitted.
* `[none]`, `[n]`: This parameter specifies that the results must not contain any keyword specified in `<keywords>`.
    This parameter may be omitted.

The “then” keyword:

If “then [Command]”  is inserted after find, the [Command] will be applied to all results of the find command.
[Command] can be replaced with either changeto, delete, or markdone.

Thus it is possible to run commands like
“in CS2101 findwhere then delete” to delete every task under CS2101
