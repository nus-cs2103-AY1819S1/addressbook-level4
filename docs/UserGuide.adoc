== Introduction

ThanePark is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing the rides in
your theme park!*. More importantly, ThanePark is *optimized for those who prefer
to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ThanePark can get your
ride information faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump
to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Steps to set up ThanePark:

.  Check that you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `thanepark.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ThanePark.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
