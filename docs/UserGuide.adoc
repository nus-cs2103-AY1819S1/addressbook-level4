== Introduction

Non-profit organizations rely on volunteer work to maintain parts of their operations. A volunteer management system is
essential in helping to retain volunteers by ensuring that there is a large enough pool of volunteers who are motivated
to support the various events. Therefore, it is critical that a organization is able
to source the right person for the right activity.

SocialCare is an application that is designed to help your organization manage your volunteers effectively.
You will be able to:

* Manage volunteer information such as contact details.
* Manage events for your organization.
* Create volunteering records for your volunteers.

Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started.

Enjoy!

A certificate will be exported only if *the volunteer has event records* and *at least 1 record has a positive, non-zero hour value*.
====

Example:

* `exportcert 1` +
Exports a PDF certificate for the volunteer at index 1 to the user's current working directory.
A success message will also be displayed in the following form: 'Certificate exported for volunteer at INDEX 1 to <EXPORT PATH>'.

[NOTE]
====
*Where will my files be exported to?*

If SocialCare has the permission to create folders on your machine, the certificates will be exported to a folder named 'Certs'. Else, they can be found next to the .jar file used to run the application.
====

Here is what the exported certificate will look like: (Note that the number within the square brackets [ ] following the event name corresponds to the event ID)

.Sample exported volunteer certificate
[.thumb]
image::CurrentVolunteerCert.png[width="450"]

An empty line is provided at the end of the certificate for manual signing off. Feel free to add a signature or an organizational stamp to add credibility to the certificate!

[NOTE]
====
To avoid exported file name clashes for volunteers with the same name, we have appended the volunteer's NRIC to the filename as well. Exported file names will have the format '<VOLUNTEER NAME>_<VOLUNTEER NRIC>.pdf' (E.g. John Doe_S8512345A.pdf)
====
// end::exportcert-sharan-ppp[]

You can refer to the following flowchart to better understand the feedback messages displayed by the application, and derive what your subsequent actions should be. (E.g. If you get the message "The volunteer index provided is invalid.", then try replacing the <INDEX> you had input.)
