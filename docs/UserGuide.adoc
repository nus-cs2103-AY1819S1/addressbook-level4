[caption="Message: "]

image::calculate_screenshot.png[width="880"]

// end::calculateug[]

// tag::notify[]
[[Features-Notify]]
=== Enabling Notification : `notify`

[IMPORTANT]
====


* Enabling notification requires you to have already {sourceDir}/UserGuide.html#Features-Select[selected a car park].
* If you have not done so, please look at how to {sourceDir}/UserGuide.html#Features-Find[find car parks by location]
and {sourceDir}/UserGuide.html#Features-Filter[filter them through the use of flags].
* Also, {sourceDir}/UserGuide.html#Features-Query[click here] if you have forgotten how to
use the `query` command to get a list of car parks.
====

After selecting a car park, you can choose to receive notifications on how many parking lots are still available.
It sends an update periodically, so once it is enabled you do not need to type the command again into the _Command Box_.

[[notifyformat]]
[cols="^.^3,^.^4,^.^1", width="60%", options="header"]
|===
| Format | Abbreviation | Example(s)
| notify TIME_SECONDS | n / no / not / noti / notif | notify 0 +
notify 10
|===

* If you did not {sourceDir}/UserGuide.html#Features-Select[select] a car park beforehand, _Car Park Finder_ would not know
which car park needs to be updated.
* You can set within a range of _10 to 600 seconds_ (10 minutes). *Decimal values are not allowed.*
* Typing `query` or `clear` will disable the notification.
* As `notify` is based on the index of `select`, you can select another car park to receive notification while it is enabled.
* This means if you type `find hougang` and the original car park is gone but the index is still valid, it will update that car park instead.

'''

==== Example: Receive notification every 10 seconds
|===
| This example assumes you have already decided on a car park. For more information on how you can choose a
suitable car park in _Car Park Finder_, please [underline]#<<Features-Notify, click here>>#.
|===

It is time to head to your destination. Before you do so, why not check if the car park is full?

.Selected Car Park AM18
[[zy_select_notify]]
image::zy_select_notify.png[width="700"]

Step 1. Select your car park from the list. In this example, we will choose the 5th car park as shown in
[underline]#<<zy_select_notify>>#.

[caption="Message: "]
.Turning on notification
|===

Interval: every 10 seconds
|===

Step 2. Type `notify 10` into the _Command Box_. The message above should appear in the _Message Box_

.Notification with lot(s) taken
|===
| Car park AM18 has 152 lot(s) available +
7 lot(s) taken since last check +
Interval: every 10 seconds
|===

Step 3. Now that the notification is enabled, you do not have to do anything else. It will inform you whether there is
a change in parking lots availability through visual updates like
[underline]#<<notifynochange, these messages above>># and [underline]#<<zy_notify_ba>>#.

==== Example: Turn off notification

Now that you have gotten tired of the notification, it is time to disable it.

[caption="Message: "]
.Turning off notification
|===
