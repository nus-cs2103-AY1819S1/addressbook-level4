By: `Team Concierge(TM)`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

Concierge(TM) is created for *hotel managers and receptionists* of small hotels looking for a simple application to *assist
the user in hotel management*. More importantly, Concierge(TM) is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface*
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Concierge(TM) can get your
hotel management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `concierge.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Concierge(TM).
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list -r`* : lists all rooms
* **`checkin`**`r/001` : checks in the first booking of room 001
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.


[[Terminology]]
//tag::terminology[]
== Terminology
Some important things that you should know before using Concierge(TM)

====

* Room numbers must be a *3-digit number from 001 to 100*. For example,
** 001, 050, 074, 100 are valid
** 000, 01, 99, 101 are invalid

* The format used for dates is *d/M/y*, whereby
** *d* - Day can be 1 or 2 digits
** *M* - Month can be 1 or 2 digits
** *y* - Year can be 2 or 4 digits (if 2 digits, date is assumed to be in the current century)

* A *Booking* ...
** is *Active* if the period between its start and end date includes today's date, inclusively.
** is *Upcoming* if its start date is strictly after today's date.
** is *Expired* if its end date is strictly before today's date.
** is *Outdated* if its start date is strictly before today's date.
** is *Overlapping* with another booking if its start date is strictly before the other's end date AND the other's start date is strictly before its end date
** can be uniquely identified by its start date.

* Two *guests* are...
** *different* if they have different names
** *different* if they have the same name AND both their phone numbers and emails are different
** *same* if they have the same name AND either their phone number or email, or both, are the same

* There are 2 guest lists:
** *Checked-in guest list* contains all the guests who are currently checked-in.
** *Archived guest list* contains all guests who have ever stayed in the hotel before.
** Therefore, it is possible for a guest who has made a booking to be in
*** neither lists - guest has yet to check-in and has never stayed in the hotel before
*** checked-in guest list only - guest has checked-in and has never stayed in the hotel before
*** archived guest list only - guest has not checked-in and has stayed in the hotel before
*** both lists - guest has checked-in and has stayed in the hotel before

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

//tag::add[]
=== Adding a booking: `add` image:icon-key.png[width="32"]

Adds a booking associated with a guest, room and booking period. +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL [t/TAG] r/ROOM_NUMBER from/START_DATE to/END_DATE`

[NOTE]
A valid booking cannot clash with an existing booking. It must also have a
  start date from today onwards (i.e. not outdated).

****
* A guest can have any number of tags (including 0)
* A guest can make an unlimited number of bookings with the hotel.
* When adding a booking, the guest will *not* be added to the archived guest list or checked-in guest list.
Their personal information will be stored under their booking in the room.
****

Example: `add n/John Smith p/98765432 e/johnsmith@gmail.com t/VIP r/085
from/17/12/18 to/19/12/18`

Add a guest "John Smith" to room 085 for the period of stay from 17/12/18 to
19/12/18.

Adding an inactive booking: you can view the booking by selecting the
relevant room, under "All other bookings". Only active bookings (i.e. start
date is today) can be seen on the left room pane.

image::AddCommand-userguide-notactive.png[width="800"]
// end::add[]

//tag::checkin[]
=== Check-in room: `checkin` image:icon-key.png[width="32"]

Checks in the first booking of a room. The guest who made the booking will be added to
the checked-in guest list.

****
* If the guest's name is not found in any of the entries in the checked-in guest list, then a new entry will be created.
* Suppose there is already an entry with the same name as the guest in the checked-in guest list.
** If both the guest's phone number and email are the same as the ones found in the entry, or only one of them is different,
then he/she is *treated as the same guest as the one in the entry, and thus the entry will not be updated*.
** If both the guest's phone number and email are different from the ones found in the entry,
then he/she is *treated as a different guest from the one in the entry, and a new entry will be created*.
****

[cols="^.^1,<.^11a", frame=none]
|===
|image:icon-important.png[Important info]
|Expired and upcoming bookings *cannot* be checked-in.
|===

Format: `checkin r/ROOM_NUMBER`


Examples:

* `checkin r/085` +
Checks in room 085, marks room 085's current booking as checked-in, and adds the guest who made the booking
to the checked-in guest list.
//end::checkin[]

//tag::checkout[]
=== Checkout room: `checkout` image:icon-key.png[width="32"]

Checks out the room's first (i.e. earliest) booking, or its booking with the specified start date.
Also updates the checked-in guest list and archived guest list with the guest who made the booking.

****
* If the guest does not have any other checked-in bookings, then he/she will be removed from the checked-in
guest list. Otherwise, he/she will *not* be removed from the checked-in guest list.
* If the guest has checked-in, he/she will be added to the archived guest list.
** If the guest's name is not found in any of the entries in the archived guest list, then a new entry will be created.
** Suppose there is already an entry with the same name as the guest in the archived guest list.
*** If both the guest's phone number and email are the same as the ones found in the entry, or only one of them is different,
then he/she is *treated as the same guest as the one in the entry, and thus the entry will not be updated*.
*** If both the guest's phone number and email are different from the ones found in the entry,
then he/she is *treated as a different guest from the one in the entry, and a new entry will be created*.
****

[TIP]
`checkout` 's intended use is the deletion of any booking.
 This means that you can delete a non-checked-in booking using `checkout`.

Format: `checkout r/ROOM_NUMBER [from/START_DATE]`

Examples:

* `checkout r/085` +
Checks out room 085 and the room's first booking.

Checks out the booking with start date 01/11/18 from room 085.
//end::checkout[]

//tag::reassign[]
=== Reassigning a guest to another room : `reassign` image:icon-key.png[width="32"]

Reassigns a booking from one room to another. The room's expenses will also be ported over to the new room.

[cols="^.^1,<.^11a", frame=none]
|===
|image:icon-important.png[role="center"]
| You can reassign a booking only if:

* The new room is different from the original.
* Neither the booking nor any of the new room's bookings are expired.
* The booking does not overlap with any of the new room's bookings.
* If the booking ends the same day that the new room's first booking starts, the new room's first booking cannot be checked-in.
* If the booking starts the same day that the new room's first booking ends, the booking cannot be checked-in.
|===


Format: `reassign r/ROOM_NUMBER from/START_DATE nr/NEW_ROOM_NUMBER`

Examples:

* `reassign r/085 from/01/11/18 nr/086` +

//end::reassign[]

//tag::find[]
=== Locating guests and rooms : `find`

Finds guests or rooms, depending on the input flag and the keyword filters.

Format: `find FLAG FILTER [MOREFILTERS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Guests names and tags matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
* Any number of filters can be chained and used together
****

Filters for Guest / Checked-in Guests (-g/-cg):

* `n/` - Name
* `p/` - Phone Number
* `e/` - Email Address
* `t/` - Tags

Filters for Rooms (-r):

* `r/` - Room Number
* `c/` - Capacity

* `-hb` - Has Bookings Flag*
* `-nb` - No Bookings Flag*
* `from/` - Booking Start Date^
* `to/` - Booking End Date^

[cols="^.^1,<.^11a", frame=none]
|===
|image:icon-important.png[Important info]
|
Flags marked with * cannot be used together in the same command. +
These flags can be used independently, or with flags marked with ^ .
|===

Examples:

=======

=======

//end::find[]

// tag::list[]
=== Listing all guests : `list`

Shows the entire list of rooms, checked-in guests, or archived guests, depending on the input flag +
Format: `list FLAG`

Examples:

* `list -r` +
List all rooms
* `list -g` +
List all archived guests
* `list -cg` +
List all checked-in guests
// end::list[]

// tag::loginlogout[]
=== Login : `login`

Logs in to the Concierge(TM) application. +
Format: `login user/USERNAME pw/PASSWORD`

Note: The username and password are both case-sensitive.

[TIP]
The default account can be accessed with `login user/admin pw/passw0rd`

A login allows the user to access the commands which can affect the
bookings. +
Commands which require login: `add`, `checkin`, `checkout`,
`reassign`, `service` and `clear`.

Example: `login user/admin pw/passw0rd`

`clear` +
`"This command requires you to sign in."` +
Attempting to clear Concierge(TM) without a login is not allowed.

`login user/admin pw/passw0rd` +
`"Successfully signed in as: admin"` +
Login with a valid account, such as the default one provided.

After signing in, the `clear` command can now be executed.

==== Adding a new account

 Currently, Concierge(TM) does not have a feature for users to add an account via the app. Nevertheless, for the adventurous users who want to do so, this sub-section will be useful.

Step 1: Concierge(TM) uses SHA-256 password hashing. This hash for your
*password* can be generated using this
https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/[tool].

[NOTE]
 Concierge(TM) is designed to work for alphanumeric usernames and passwords in
 mind. Do not enter symbols (!, @, %...). Do not begin or end your passwords
 with whitespaces.

Step 2: Add the entry to the `passwords.json` file. This should be in the
same location as `concierge.jar`. Note that entries are separated with a
comma. +
Format: `"username" : "hashedPassword"`

In the image below, a new account with username "newUser" and password
"mySecurePassw0rd" has been added.

image::LogInCommand-addpasswordentry.png[width="900"]

Step 3: Close and reload the Concierge(TM) application, and your new account
will be recognised.

[NOTE]
 The parsing of the `passwords.json` file is delicate. Currently, if you
 enter a valid json file format but an incorrect password reference list
 format, you will end up with no default account. To resolve this, delete the
  `passwords.json` file and re-run Concierge(TM).

=== Logout : `logout`

Logs out of the Concierge(TM) application. +
Format: `logout`

* The special classes of commands (as documented in <<Login : `login`,
login>>) can no longer be executed.
* The `logout` command will erase the command history, so users cannot undo/
redo commands executed before the logout.
** Even if you login again, you cannot
 undo your previous actions.
** This achieves the same effect as closing and re-opening Concierge(TM)
after a logout.

Example: `logout`

// end::loginlogout[]

=== Selecting a guest : `select`

Selects the guest or room identified by the index number used in the displayed list. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* Selects the guest or room and displays its information in the detailed panel on the right.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `list -g` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd guest in the displayed list.
* `list -r` +
`select 100` +
Selects the 100th room in the displayed list.

// tag::service[]
=== Provide Room Service: `service` image:icon-key.png[width="32"]

Charges a room service to a room  +
Format: `service r/ROOM_NUMBER no/ITEM_NUMBER [c/COST]`

`ITEM_NUMBER` refers to the number in the menu given to each type of service offered by the hotel.
The default Menu that comes with Concierge(TM) consists of the following items:

* *RS01* -- Room service: Red wine -- $50.00
* *RS02* -- Room service: Beef steak -- $70.00
* *RS03* -- Room service: Thai massage -- $100.00
* *MB01* -- Minibar: Coca cola -- $3.00
* *MB02* -- Minibar: Sprite -- $3.00
* *MB03* -- Minibar: Tiger beer -- $6.00
* *MB04* -- Minibar: Mineral water -- $3.00
* *SP01* -- Swimming pool: Entry -- $5.00
* *XX01* -- Adjustment: Discount -- $0.00
* *XX02* -- Adjustment: Typo -- $0.00

[cols="^.^1,<.^11a", frame=none]
|===
|image:icon-important.png[role="center"]
|
* The cost can be specified if the guest is to be charged an amount that is
  different from the cost in the menu. Note that the cost has to follow a strict format
  such as 100.00, i.e. with two decimal places. The dollar part of the cost should also
  not exceed `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
* Only occupied rooms (i.e. rooms with checked-in guests) can have expenses charged to it.
* Items in the Menu may be modified, added, or removed through `concierge.xml`.
  Only item numbers from the Menu (case-sensitive) may be used in the `service` command.
  Future versions will allow displaying of the Menu on the main app.
|===

[TIP]
Negative values can be used in `service` command. This can be used in cases such as when
a guest uses a voucher, hence allowing the total expenses to be reduced. Negative
values can also be charged if the user wants to remove or edit an existing expense.
The two expense types, XX01 and XX02, were thus created for the purpose of adjustments.

Examples:

* `service r/085 no/RS01` +
Adds an expenditure of the item *RS01* to the room's expenses.

* `service r/096 no/RS03 c/12.34` +
Adds an expenditure of the item *RS03* to the room's expenses and charge $12.34 for it.
// end::service[]

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[cols="^.^1,<.^11a", frame=none]
|===
|image:icon-important.png[Important info]
|Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous
and next input respectively in the command box.
|===

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the Concierge(TM) application to the state before the previous
_undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[cols="^.^1,<.^11a", frame=none]
|===
|image:icon-important.png[Important info]
|Undoable commands: those commands that modify Concierge(TM)'s content
(`add`, `checkin`, `checkout`, `reassign`, `service` and `clear`).
|===

Examples:

* `checkin r/001` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `checkin r/001` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `checkin r/001` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `checkin r/001` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `checkin r/001` +
`undo` (reverses the `checkin r/001` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `checkin r/001` command) +

* `checkin r/001` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `checkin r/001` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `checkin r/001` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `checkin r/001` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::clear[]
=== Clearing all entries : `clear` image:icon-key.png[width="32"]

Clears all entries from the application. +
Format: `clear`

The rooms are maintained - only all their current and future bookings are
cleared. I.e. all maintenance requests and faults will still be recorded.

Example: `clear`

image::ClearCommand-success.png[width="400"]
// end::clear[]

// tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete: kbd:[Ctrl], kbd:[Alt]

Auto-completes a partially typed in command by a user.

**Function** Press kbd:[Alt] to quick-clear the `CommandBox` (saves time
             for user when he wants to clear the box).

The command box before kbd:[Alt] is pressed:

image::servicepreclear.png[width="419"]

The command box aft kbd:[Alt] is pressed:

image::servicepostclear.png[width="371"]

**Format**: Enter `COMMAND_WORD`, followed by kbd:[Ctrl] key.

**Function**: Press kbd:[Ctrl] key again to proceed to the next prefix.

Example: +
**Step 1**: User enters `a` in `CommandBox`.

image::add.png[width="579"]

**Step 2**: After kbd:[Ctrl] has been pressed, it automatically inserts the
        command and the first parameter `PREFIX_NAME` in the command line.

image::addPREFIX_NAME.png[width="581"]

**Step 3**: After filling up the name field, e.g. with Anthony, then press
        kbd:[Space]. Finally, to insert the next parameter `PREFIX_PHONE`
        press kbd:[Ctrl].

image::afteranthonyspace.png[width="581"]

**Step 4**: Repeat Step 3 until all the parameters are input, then press
        kbd:[Enter] to execute the command.

image::fulladdautocomplete.png[width="953"]

**Note(s)**:

* For finishing entering a prefix field e.g. 'n/John Doe', user
has to insert kbd:[Space] on his/her own before pressing kbd:[Ctrl]
again, to autocomplete the next prefix. +

* For commands such as `checkin` and `checkout`, user has to specify
up till at least `checki` or `checko` because the application
is unable to distinguish from the two commands without sufficient
information. The subsequent prefixes will follow suit accordingly.
// end::autocomplete[]

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

****
* Only one help session can be in place at each time.
* Your help session resets each time you close the window.
* Your help session is retained if the window is not closed.
