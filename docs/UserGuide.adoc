== Introduction

SuperTA is a desktop app for *Teaching Assistants* and *Professors* of NUS School of Computing to manage their tutorials and students. It is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Jump to <<Quick Start>> section to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `superTA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your SuperTA client.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `list` : lists all students in the directory
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com id/A0123456Y` : adds a student named `John Doe` to the student directory.
* `create-tutorial-group id/1a n/My First Tutorial Group`: Creates a tutorial group named `My First Tutorial Group` with the ID `1a`
* `delete 3` : shows the 3rd student in the current list that was deleted
* `exit` : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
