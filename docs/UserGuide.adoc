== Introduction

Debt Tracker (DT) is for those *who prefer to use a desktop app for tracking the user’s loans.*
DT has a mixed usage of *Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI).*
For more basic commands, one may use CLI, but DT has also simplified potentially longer commands through the use of GUI.
DT can keep a record of your loans and debts as fast as other apps, if not faster!

== Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java version 9 or later installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest debttracker.jar.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Debt Tracker.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window.

Refer to Section 3, “Features” for details of each command.
