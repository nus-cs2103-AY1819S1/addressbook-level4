== Introduction

Flashbook is for those who prefer to use a desktop app to manage their to-do for university. Flashbook is *designed for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users who can type fast can navigate and use the to-do list faster than traditional GUI apps. Makes your hand itchy and want to try out? Go to <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `flashbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Flash Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : Display all existing tasks on the display.
* **`add`**`n this add high Problem_5.12 with deadline on 100918: the most difficult one` : adds a task named `Problem_5.12` to the FlashBook and set the deadline of the task to due on `10/08/18`.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in square brackets are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `changeto [tag] with [TaskParameters]`, `TaskParameters` and `tag` are parameters which can be used as `changeto urgent with deadline on 110918`.
* Words in square brackets are optional. e.g. `changeto [tag] with [TaskParameters]` can be used as `changeto with deadline on 110918` or `changeto urgent`

====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a new task: `add`

Add a new task named [Task Name] with parameters described in [Task Parameters] to the module [Module Name]. +
Format: `in [Module Name] add [Tag] [Task Name] with [Task Parameters]:[Description]`

[NOTE]
If Module Name is “this” or “&”, the new task will be added as a subtask of the selected task

.Possible tags are:
* urgent / u
* high / h
* normal / n (default)
* low / l
* done / d (this task will not show up in the find command unless specified)

.Possible task parameters:

* Deadline: `deadline on DDMMYY`, or the shorthand `dlDDMMYY`
* Location: `@[Location Name]`

* `in ST2131 add urgent Homework_1 with deadline on 170918 @S17:12 pages of statistics.` : In Module ST2131, add task Homework_1 with deadline on `17/09/18`, with task description of `12 pages of statistics` and location of task is at `S17`.
* `#ST2131 a u Homework_1 dl170918 @S17:12 pages of statistics.`
* `in this add high Problem_5.12 with deadline on 100918: the most difficult one`
* `#& a h Problem_5.12 dl100918: the most difficult one`

[NOTE]
[Task Name] must be a string without spaces and is not a restricted keyword.

=== Editing a task : `changeto`
****
Pre-condition: Task is already selected using `select` command. +
****
Replace the selected tasks’ parameters with those described in this command (undescribed parameters will not be changed) +

Format: `changeto [Tag] with [TaskParameters]:[TaskDescription]`, or the shorthand `c [Tag] w [Taskparameters]:[TaskDescription]`

Examples:

* `changeto urgent with deadline on 150918: only ten pages is needed` +
Edits task selected to be of `urgent` tag and deadline on `15/09/18`, with task description of `only ten pages is needed`.
* `ct u w dl120918` +
Edit task selected tagging it with `urgent` and set its deadline to `12/09/18`
* `changeto with deadline on 110918: deadline extended` +
Edit task selected deadline to `11/09/18`

=== Deleting a task: `delete/del`
****
Pre-condition: Task is already selected using select command
****
Remove the selected task. +
Format: `delete`, or the shorthand `del`


=== Managing the module list: modules

Management of modules in FlashBook. Capabilities of FlashBook module system includes:

- Create a module: `modules create [Module Name]`, or `+\#[Module Name]`
- Delete a module: `modules delete [Module Name]`, or `~#[Module Name]`
- List modules: `modules`, or `#`
- List tasks in the module: `modules [Module Name]`, or `#[Module Name]`
- Delete all modules: `modules delete \*` or `~*`

Examples:

* modules create CS2103T
* modules delete CS2101
* +#ST2334
* ~#CS2040
* #CS2040
* #
* ~*

`[Module Name] must be an alphanumeric string without spaces.`

=== Find a task: `find`

The `find` command searches the AddressBook for specified persons, groups, or meetings, and displays the results on
the panel. +

Syntax: +
 Longhand: `find [person|group|meeting]  *[all]/<keywords> *[some]/<keywords> *[none]/<keywords>` +
 Shorthand: `find [p|g|m] *[a]/<keyword...> *[s]/<keywords> *[n]/<keywords>` +


* `[person|group|meeting]`, `[p|g|m]`: This parameter specifies whether to search for persons, groups, or meetings.
    This parameter is required to execute this command.
    ** `person`, `p`: Specifies to search for persons.
    ** `group`, `g`: Specifies to search for groups.
    ** `meeting`, `m`: Specifies to search for meetings.
* `<keywords>`: This tag contains any number of keywords separated by a kbd:[space].
* `[all]`, `[a]`: This parameter specifies that the results must contain every keyword specified in `<keywords>`.
    This parameter may be omitted.
* `[some]`, `[s]`: This parameter specifies that the results must contain at least one keyword specified in `<keywords>`.
    This parameter may be omitted.
* `[none]`, `[n]`: This parameter specifies that the results must not contain any keyword specified in `<keywords>`.
    This parameter may be omitted.





The “then” keyword:

If “then [Command]”  is inserted after find, the [Command] will be applied to all results of the find command.
[Command] can be replaced with either changeto, delete, or markdone.

Thus it is possible to run commands like
“in CS2101 findwhere then delete” to delete every task under CS2101



=== Selecting a task : `select`

****
Pre-condition: user already list all available tasks using  find/findwhere command
Select and displays a task from the list obtained using find
****

Format: `“select [index]” or “s[index]” when [index] is a positive integer (starts from 1)`

****
* This also display all subtasks of the selected task.
  If a task is already on display, this command instead select a subtask from the displayed tasks’ list of subtasks.
****

=== Add Meeting to Group: `meet`

Add a meeting to the group specified by its name.

Format: `meet [groupname] n/[meetingname] t/[meetingtime] l/[meetinglocation] d/[meetingdescription]`

Meeting time is specified in the format `dd-mm-yyyy@hh:mm`

Not specifying any fields will cancel the meeting associated with the group.

Example:
* `Meet CS2103 n/Demo Rehearsal t/11-11-2018@11:11 l/COM1 02-18 d/preparation for the upcoming product demo`
* `Meet CS2103` note that this will cancel the current meeting with the group CS2103.

`Export all tasks of [Module Name]: export #[Module Name] <relative filepath>`

`export f/<filepath>`

Example:
`export f/backup.xml` : Export FlashBook as `backup.xml`.

== Change Storage Location: `filepath`

Change the storage location of FlashBook.
Format: +
`filepath f/<filepath>`

Example:
