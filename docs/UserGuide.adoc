== Introduction

Piconso is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for editing images*. More importantly, Piconso is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Piconso can edit your images faster than Photoshop. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `piconso.jar` link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T09-3/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Piconso.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

== Getting started

Let's work through a simple project in Piconso from start to finish.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create some of the dankest memes starting from a blank template.

If you ever get stuck with a command, pop down to the Features section for reference!

.The Piconso team knows how it feels.

Ready to start your Piconso journey?

. Head over to the link https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T09-3/main/blob/master/docs/images/tutorial.zip[here] to get a zip file with all the assets you need to get started!
. Unzip the files into somewhere easy to access, like your Pictures folder.
. Start Piconso!
. Use the `cd` and `ls` commands to get to the folder with your unzipped assets.
You can use the `TAB` key to auto-complete pesky folder names! If everything went well, you should see all your images show up in the Image Panel.

.Images and index are showing up!
image::tutorial/step 1.png[width:2000]

[start=5]
. See the number below the base image? It might be different depending on your folder's content. If you don't see it within the first ten images, use the `next` and `prev` command to navigate!
. Open the image simply by typing `open [index]`. __(Substitute index with the number you noted down just now)__
. You should see the base template in all its glory.

.Ready to rumble.
image::tutorial/step 2.png[width:2000]

[start=8]
. Now we can start layering the other images on top of the base image. Let's start by adding the coveralls logo.
We do that by using the `layer add` command. The logo is at index 3 for us so we enter `layer add 3`.

.Not exactly where we want it but it's a start.
image::tutorial/step 3.png[width:2000]

[start=9]
. The logo is a bit too big for our liking so let's resize it a bit. Start by selecting the layer that the logo is on with a quick `layer select 2`.
. Follow up with `apply resize 70%` and put Coveralls down a peg or two.

.Why don't you pick on someone your own **SIZE** huh? Get it? Size?
image::tutorial/step 4.png[width:2000]

[start=11]
. The logo isn't where we want it so let's move it right to the balloon.
Hit it with a `layer position 295x50`.

.And that's for rejecting my pull request!
image::tutorial/step 5.png[width:2000]

[start=12]
. Repeat steps 8 - 11 to place `regret.png` somewhere on the pink monster. Remember to select the new layer before you start to resize and reposition! __(Psst. resize for 60% and move it to (5, 450) if you don't feel like experimenting.)__

.Do androids dream of 100% code coverage?
image::tutorial/step 6.png[width:2000]

[start=13]
. Let's save our work before **DEEP FRY** the living daylights out of it! You can do that by typing `save arrangement.png` or if you're feeling adventurous just `save` will overwrite your current file irreversibly.
. Open our file again, refer to step 5 and 6 if you need help.
. Now we can begin to use some of the more advanced features in Piconso! We add some noise to the image with `apply raw +noise gaussian`.
. Feel free to repeat the step 15 a few times to get the desired amount of noise! We did it five times to be sure. If you ever go overboard, use the `undo` command to ... undo the previous command. But face it, you're going to `redo` it anyway.

.Noisy indeed.
image::tutorial/step 7.png[width:2000]

[start=17]
. Now we bump the contrast up, **way** __way__ up with `apply raw -contrast-stretch 15%`.
. Brightness and saturation gets the same boost with `apply raw -modulate 120,120`.
. Apply the finishing touches with an unsharp mask! `apply raw -unsharp 0x05`. Now the meme is starting to take shape!

.New and improved image, now with 500% more noise, 120% more brightness, 120% more saturation!
image::tutorial/step 8.png[width:2000]

[start=20]
. We are almost done! Repeat steps 8 - 11 again to slap some of the emojis on.
You can use the `apply rotate [degree]` command to spice the meme up a bit. If you're short on time, we've provided the exact resize and new positions:

 For the crying emoji:
    layer position 125x330
    apply resize 20%
    apply rotate 75

 For the 2 OK emojis:
    apply resize 10%
    layer position 270x390
    apply rotate 80

.You're finna gonna yeet this image.
image::tutorial/step 9.png[width:2000]

[start=21]
. Save the image again (`save lit_meme.png`) and we're ready to upload our image!
. Login with the aptly named `login` command. Don't worry, Piconso will never store your password in any shape or form!
. Upload the file with `g ul <lit_meme.png>`. You should see a confirmation message when the upload is complete.
. `logout` when you're done! Congrats, you have just went from to a Piconso-certified meme hero!

Before we let you go, wonder how we made the very first image you saw? Try this before you go!

[start=25]
. Add the base image back in, the base image will take up all the canvas space but don't worry.
. Select the layer which the original image is on and move it out of the way

 layer select 5
 layer position -450x0

[start=28]
. Use `canvas auto-resize on` to expand the canvas to show both of them.
. Remove the background color of the canvas with `canvas bgcolor none` or change it to something you like!

=== Redoing all transformations : `redo-all`

Format: `redo-all`: Redoes all undone transformations

Example:

* `convert blur 0x8` +
`convert contrast` +
`convert rotate 90` +
