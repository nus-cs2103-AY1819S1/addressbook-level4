== Introduction

Welcome to *LostBUTFound*! *LostBUTFound* is a management tool designed to help *administrators manage lost and found articles*.

LostBUTFound streamlines this management process and help you to increase your productivity.

More importantly, LostBUTFound is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Fast typists will find that LostBUTFound can manage lost and found articles faster than traditional GUI applications.
