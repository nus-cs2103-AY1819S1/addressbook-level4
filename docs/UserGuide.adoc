== Introduction
Welcome to the *Anakin* User Guide!

*Anakin*  was built for those who *want to make heavy use of flashcards without the hassle of managing physical copies*. More importantly, Anakin is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Anakin started from our desire to help users organize their flashcards better, and to reduce the paper waste generated by flashcards. As students ourselves, we believe that studying should be effective and easy to plan. Thus, we have built
in a scheduling system into Anakin which will help you plan out when to review your flashcards for optimal studying performance. Our scheduler uses spaced repetition which is the result of years
of https://www.supermemo.com/help/smalg.htm[psychology research]. Spaced repetiton embodies the idea that last minute studying has little effect. Instead, study sessions should be spread out to allow a student to best absorb infromation.

With this studying tool, we hope to not just decrease paper wastage but also to create a fun environment which can help students sustain their motivation to study
throughout the semester.

To get started, head over to <<Quick Start>>!

For a quick review of commands, check out <<Command Summary>>.
== How to Use This Guide
