== Introduction

Piconso is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for editing images*. More importantly, Piconso is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Piconso can edit your images faster than Photoshop. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `piconso.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Piconso.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

=== Applying a transformation to an image : `add`

Format: `add [TRANSFORMATION]`: adds a specific transformation to the current set of transformation thus far

Custom defined transformation by user (see save set, 3.5)

* Format: `add [-NAME_OF_TRANSFORMATION_SET]`

Available transformations

* `crop`: crops an image to a specified size.  X and Y offset values represent the location of the top left corner of the cropped image with respect to the original image

** Format: `add -crop [X-POSITION][Y-POSITION]`

* `gblur`: performs gaussian blur on the currently opened image

** Format: `add -gblur [AMOUNT]`

* `hue`: changes the overall hue of the image by rotating colors on color wheel (i.e rotating by a certain degree to map red all red in image to purple)

** Format: `add -hue [VALUE_OF_ROTATION]`

* `brightness`: changes the brightness of the image. VALUE [-100, 100]

** Format: `add -brightness [VALUE]`

* `contrast`: adjust the contrast of the image. VALUE [0, 100]

** Format: `add -contrast [VALUE]`

=== Saving images/transformation set : `save`

Format: `save -image [IMAGE_NAME]`: saves the transformed image +
Format: `save -set [SET_NAME]`: saves the transformation set added thus far into a new transformation type

Examples:

* `save -image exampleImage` +
* `save -set exampleSet`

=== Adding images to working set: `select`

Format: `select [IMAGE_NAME]`: adds an image to the current working set
Format: `select -all`: adds all images in current directory from working set

Examples:

* `select exampleImage` +
* `select -all`

=== Removing images from working set : `deselect`

Format: `deselect [IMAGE_NAME]`: removes an image from the current working set
Format: `deselect -all`: removes all images in current directory from working set

Examples:

* `deselect exampleImage` +
* `deselect -all`

=== Clear history of transformations : `clear`

Format: `clear`: clears all history of transformations on image

=== Undoing previous actions : `undo`

Format: `undo`: Step back to previous transformation

`undo` (reverses the `select -all` command) +

* `add -brightness 50` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
