== Introduction

MeetingBook is for those who prefer to use a desktop app to manage their meetings for university. MeetingBook is *designed for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users who can type fast can navigate and use the meeting planner faster than traditional GUI apps. Makes your hand itchy and want to try out? Go to <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your computer.
.  Download the latest `meetingbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your MeetingBook.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : Display all existing members on the display.
* **`addMember`**`n/<name> p/<phone> e/<email> a/<address>` : adds a member with the parameters specified to the MeetingBook.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd person shown in the current person list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== User Interface
This section will explain the user interface of the application.

=== Finding a group / person / meeting: `find`

The `find` command searches the MeetingBook for specified person, group, or meeting, and displays the results on
the panel. +

Syntax: +
 Longhand: `find [person|group|meeting]  *[all]/<keywords> *[some]/<keywords> *[none]/<keywords>` +
 Shorthand: `find [p|g|m] *[a]/<keyword...> *[s]/<keywords> *[n]/<keywords>` +

* `[person|group|meeting]`, `[p|g|m]`: This parameter specifies whether to search for persons, groups, or meetings.
    This parameter is required to execute this command.
    ** `person`, `p`: Specifies to search for persons.
    ** `group`, `g`: Specifies to search for groups.
    ** `meeting`, `m`: Specifies to search for meetings.
* `<keywords>`: This tag contains any number of keywords separated by a kbd:[space].
* `[all]`, `[a]`: This parameter specifies that the results must contain every keyword specified in `<keywords>`.
    This parameter may be omitted.
* `[some]`, `[s]`: This parameter specifies that the results must contain at least one keyword specified in `<keywords>`.
    This parameter may be omitted.
* `[none]`, `[n]`: This parameter specifies that the results must not contain any keyword specified in `<keywords>`.
    This parameter may be omitted.

The “then” keyword:

If “then [Command]”  is inserted after find, the [Command] will be applied to all results of the find command.
[Command] can be replaced with either changeto, delete, or markdone.

Thus it is possible to run commands like
“in CS2101 findwhere then delete” to delete every task under CS2101

=== Selecting a group / person / meeting: `select`

Format: `select [person|group|meeting] [index]` where `[index]` is a positive integer (starts from 1)

****
* If `select [group]` is entered, the person list will be filtered to show only person who belong to the group, and the
meeting list will be filtered to show only meeting scheduled for the group.
* If `select [person]` is entered, only the person that is in the filtered person list will be selected.
* If `select [meeting]` is entered, only the meeting that is in the filtered meeting list will be selected.
****

Examples:

* `select g/1`: selects the first group in the filtered group list.
* `select m/3`: selects the third meeting in the filtered meeting list.
* `select p/2`: selects the second person in the filtered person list.

=== Schedule meetings: `meet`

To schedule a meeting, use the `meet` command.

Format: `meet GROUP_NAME n/MEETING_NAME t/MEETING_TIME l/MEETING_LOCATION d/MEETING_DESCRIPTION`

* Schedules a meeting with the group `GROUP_NAME`
* Either all or none of the fields must be provided.
* In case that none of the fields is provided, the command will cancel the meeting associated with the group.
* Scheduling a new meeting to the same group overwrites the old meeting.

[NOTE]
`MEETING_TIME` is specified in the format `dd-mm-yyyy@hh:mm`

Examples:

* Example 1:
1. `meet Presentation2101 n/Demo Rehearsal t/26-10-2018@12:30 l/COM1-0218 d/Meeting for Project Demo` +
(This schedules the meeting) +
+
2. `list meeting` +
(This displays the list of meetings)

* Example 2:
1. `meet Presentation2101 n/Demo Rehearsal t/26-10-2018@12:30 l/COM1-0218 d/Meeting for Project Demo` +
(This schedules the meeting) +
+
2. `list meeting` +
(This displays `Demo Rehearsal` as the meeting associated with `Presentation 2101`) +
+
3. `meet Presentation2101 n/Discussion on Slides t/26-10-2018@12:30 l/COM1-0218 d/Some slides are wrong` +
(This overwrites `Demo Rehearsal` with `Discussion on Slides`) +
+
4. `list meeting` (`Emergency Meeting` is displayed instead of `Demo Rehearsal`)

* Example 3:
1. `meet OtherGroup ...` +
(This fails because `OtherGroup` is not in the MeetingBook)

[NOTE]
It is assumed that the group `Presentation2101` is present and is the only group in the MeetingBook and has no meeting as of the moment before each example starts.

=== Cancel meetings: `cancel`

To cancel a meeting, use the `cancel` command.

Format: `cancel GROUP_NAME`

Example:

* `cancel Project2103` (This cancels the meeting with `Project2103`)

* `cancel Project2103` +
`cancel Project2103` (This fails because the meeting is already cancelled)

[NOTE]
It is assumed that the group `Project2103` is present in the MeetingBook and has a meeting.

[NOTE]
calling `meet GROUP_NAME` without argument is equivalent to calling `cancel GROUP_NAME`.

=== Joining a person to group: `join`

Add a person, specified by name, into a group, specified by the group title. +

Format: `join n/[Name] g/[Group]` +

Example:

* `join n/Derek g/CS2103T` +
Makes the person 'Derek' to be a member of group 'CS2103T'.


[NOTE]
Both the person and group should exist in the MeetingBook.

=== Removing a person from group: `leave`

Remove a person, specified by name, from a group, specified by the group title. +

Format: `leave n/[Name] g/[Group]` +

Example:

* `leave n/Derek g/CS2101` +
Removes the person 'Derek' from the group 'CS2101'.

[NOTE]
Both the person and group should exist in the MeetingBook.
The person should also be an existing member of the group.

=== Listing all groups / meetings / persons : `list`

Display all existing groups on the group list / meetings on the meeting list / persons on the person list display.

Format: `list [group|meeting|person]`

[NOTE]
If the list is unfiltered, the list will remain the same.

Examples:

* `list group`: list all groups.
* `list meeting`: list all meetings.
* `list person`: list all persons.

// tag::import[]
=== Importing data : `import`

User is able to import other data. +

Default behaviour is to ignore any conflicting Person/Group entries unless `--force` option is supplied. +

Format: `import <relative filepath>` or `import --force <relative filepath>`

Example: +

* `import f/backup.xml` : Import backup.xml into MeetingBook +
* `import --force f/backup.xml` : Import backup.xml into MeetingBook, overwriting all conflicting entries.

The image below shows the result after successfully executing the command.

image::importSuccessfulOutput.png[width="450"]
// end::import[]

// tag::export[]
=== Exporting data : `export`

User is able to export data to store as backup elsewhere or send data to other users of MeetingBook. +

Format: `export  f/<relative filepath>` +
// Future implementation
//`Export all meetings and persons of a specific group: export #[Group] <relative filepath>`

Example: +

* `export f/backup.xml` : Export MeetingBook as `backup.xml`. +

The image below shows the result after successfully executing the command.

// end::export[]

// tag::filepath[]
=== Changing Storage Location: `filepath`

Change the storage location of MeetingBook. +

Format: `filepath f/<filepath>`

Example:

* `filepath f/new_path.xml` : Storage location of MeetingBook is now stored at `new_path.xml`.

****
[NOTE]
User can also check the current path where MeetingBook store its data using `filepath --show` command. +
