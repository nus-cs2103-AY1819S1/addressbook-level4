== Introduction

The JxMusic is a music platform that lets you add to, organize and play your digital audio collection on your computer. The player is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
//end::intro_hayden[]

// tag::quickStart_yingnan[]
== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `jxmusic.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your JxMusic player.
.  Open a terminal in the folder, enter the command `java -jar jxmusic.jar`.
    - The command should generate a `library` folder next to the jar file containing several sample mp3 files.
    - Otherwise, enter `unzip jxmusic.jar "library/*"`
    - Alternatively, download the library.zip file and unzip it next to the jar.
    - Ensure that you have the library folder with the sample mp3 files otherwise jxmusic won't start.
    - Then run `java -jar jxmusic.jar`
.  The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try with build-in tracks and playlists:

* *`playlist list`* : lists all playlists
* **`playlist new`**`p/playlist1 t/Marbles` : creates a new playlist named `playlist1` with mp3 file `Marbles` to the JxMusic Player.
* **`playlist play`**`p/playlist1` : plays the `playlist1`
* *`exit`* : exits the app
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
.  To add the new tracks to the library, add the mp3 files to the `library` folder.
.  Restart the file so that your new tracks could be scanned and showed in UI.
