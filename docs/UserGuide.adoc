== Introduction

PatientBook is a desktop application for medical professionals to manage their patient information as well as scheduling their appointments. More importantly, PatientBook is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PatientBook will allow the user to manage and access their patient information, as well as schedule their appointments more efficiently than using a traditional GUI-based application. Refer to Section 2, “Quick Start” to begin.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `patientbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Patient Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`mode user`* or *`mode patient`* : switches to patient management mode
* *`mode calender`* or *`mode cal`* : switches to appointment management mode
* *`add patient`* : automatically switches to patient management mode and begins a dialog to create a new entry in the patient database
* *`delete p301`* : deletes patient with ID '301'
* *`delete a40`* : deletes appointment with ID '40'
* *`delete appointment scheduled at 3pm next week`* : removes appointment scheduled for 3pm next week
* *`make appointment at 3pm next week`* : schedules an appointment at 3pm next week
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Command Format*

.   Commands are, in general, case sensitive.
.   Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user, eg. in `add patient n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
.   Items in square brackets are optional. +
    e.g. `make appointment [at 3pm] [next week]` will cause the program to prompt for further details.
.   Parameters may be specified in any order, eg. `make appointment next week at 3pm` is also acceptable.
====

[NOTE]
In some places in this guide, you will find that two or more commands have been placed within curly brackets and separated by forward-slashes. This indicates that the commands are equivalent. For example, `{schedule/make} appointment` indicates that `schedule appointment` and `make appointment` are both equally valid._
