== Introduction

TheTracker is for NUS students who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts, events or modules*. More importantly, TheTracker is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TheTracker can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps whilst being able to keep track with your friends! Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

This section explains how to setup TheTracker on your computer, and lists a few commands that you can try.

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `listmodules` : lists all modules
* `addperson n/John Doe t/98765432 t/johnd@example.com t/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* `delete 2` : deletes the 2nd entry in the active list
* `undo` : undoes the previous modifying action
* `exit` : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== GUI Components

This section explains the components of the GUI, along with some ways you can interact with it.

=== Layout

TheTracker's GUI is divided into 5 main regions that you will interact with:


.TheTracker's GUI

. Command Box: text box (equipped with auto-suggestions) to receive input commands
. Result Display: panel that displays the result of inputted commands
. List Panel: panel displaying all saved persons/modules/occasions

[TIP]
The info panel does not refresh even after you switch between lists, just in case you want to refer to other lists
while editing an entry. To refresh the info panel, use the `select` command.
