== Introduction

iScheduler Xs Max is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for scheduling personal events*. More importantly,
this version is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, we can get your event scheduling tasks done
faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `iScheduler Xs Max.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your iScheduler Xs Max.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`add`**`add n/Interview at Jane Street` : adds an Event named `Interview at Jane Street` to the Event Scheduler.
* *`list`* : lists all events
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd event shown in the current event
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format* +
 -- Some commands have (an) alias(es), which you can also use to execute the command e.g. to add an event to the
scheduler, you can type either `add n/Interview at Jane Street` or `a n/Interview at Jane Street`. +
 -- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/EVENT_NAME`, `EVENT_NAME` is a
parameter which can be used as `add n/Interview at Jane Street`. +
 -- Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/EVENT_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Interview at Jane Street
t/serious` or as `n/Interview at Jane Street`. +
 -- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/priority.low`, `t/fun t/serious` etc. +
 -- Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/EVENT_NAME v/VENUE`, `v/VENUE n/EVENT_NAME` is also
acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help` +
Aliases: `hel` OR `he` OR `h` +
_Coming in V2.0: Command format can be typed case-insensitive_

// tag::add[]
=== Adding an event : `add`

Adds an event to the scheduler. +
Format: `add event n/EVENT_NAME [s/START_DATETIME] [e/END_DATETIME] [d/DESCRIPTION] [v/VENUE] [rt/REPEAT_TYPE]
[ru/REPEAT_UNTIL_DATETIME] [t/TAG]... [re/REMINDER_TIME]… ` +
// end::add[]
Aliases: `ad` OR `a` in place of `add` +
_Coming in V2.0: Command format can be typed case-insensitive_

// tag::add[]
[TIP]
An event can have any number of tags and reminders(including 0).
If you want multiple tags and reminders, we need to use `[t/]` and [`re/`] for multiple times

[WARNING]
Except for tags(t/) and reminders(re/), all other fields will take in the latest field that is being input.

****
* `DATETIME` is the natural language of date and time in English.
* `REPEAT_TYPE` should be left empty or chosen from either daily, weekly or monthly.
* `REMINDER_TIME` (in `xxHxxMxxS`) represents the duration before the `START_DATETIME` that you want a pop-up alert.
* Adding events with the exact values as another event is possible.
* Only future reminders will be added. Please refer to <<Pop Up Feature>>.
****

Examples:

* `add n/Study With Yoko s/tomorrow at 3pm d/Study again and again rt/MONTHLY ru/next friday 3pm t/adhoc re/30M`

// tag::addTag[]
=== [Partial Implementation] Adding a tag : `addTag` [by v2.0]
This is the command format for adding tags.

*Note:* This feature has NOT been fully implemented yet. However, do feel free to play around with it and to report any
bugs/problems as well :)

_It will be FULLY implemented by v2.0._
// end::addTag[]

=== Listing all events : `list`

Shows a list of all events in the scheduler. +
Format: `list` +
Aliases: `lis` OR `li` OR `l` +
_Coming in V2.0: Command format can be typed case-insensitive_

[ru/REPEAT_UNTIL_DAETIME] [t/TAG]... [re/REMINDER_TIME]... [-a | -u]` +
// end::edit[]
Aliases: `edi` OR `ed` in place of `edit` +
_Coming in V2.0: Command format can be typed case-insensitive_

// tag::edit[]
[TIP]
Only one option can exists at any one time. Either `-a` or `-u`.

****
* Edits the event at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed event list.
The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the event will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the event's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* The logic for editing reminder times is the same as tags
* Only future reminders will be edited. Please refer to <<Pop Up Feature>>.
* Repeating events can be edited together using a valid option.
* `REPEAT_TYPE` and `REPEAT_UNTIL_DATETIME` cannot be edited for single events and events without a valid option.
****
// end::edit[]

The supported formats of date, time and reminder times are identical to that of
<<Adding an event : `add`, Adding an event>>. +
Refer to <<Date and time formats>> and <<Reminder time format>>.

[NOTE]
====
The current version does not auto-refresh the Google Calendar page on the right.
Please right click and select 'Reload Page' to see the effects.
Alternatively, you can select any Event using your keyboard/mouse, the page on the right will be refreshed.
====

// tag::edit[]
:sectnums!:
==== Options
`-a` +
Tell the command to select all the repeating events that are associated with the event selected.

`-u` +
Tell the command to select the upcoming events that are associated with the event selected.

Examples:

// end::edit[]
* `edit 1 n/Study with John d/Study for Mathematics exam` +
Edits the event name and description of the 1st event to be `Study with John` and `Study for Mathematics exam`
respectively.
// tag::edit[]

Edits all the repeating event's name of the 2nd event to be `Play` and clears all existing tags.
// end::edit[]
* `edit 2 re/ -u` +
Clear all the upcoming event's reminder times.


[WARNING]
=====
If your repeating events have different fields, using `-a | -u` options will overwrite individuality. +
i.e. different fields of other repeating events will be replaced by the fields of event identified by the index. +
Below is a detailed example
=====

`add n/Event v/NUS ...`:
|===
|1. Name: Event |Venue: NUS |...
|2. Name: Event |Venue: NUS |...
|3. Name: Event |Venue: NUS |...
|===
You added a set of 3 recurring events

`edit 1 n/CHANGE`:
|===
|1. Name: CHANGE |Venue: NUS |...
|2. Name: Event  |Venue: NUS |...
|3. Name: Event  |Venue: NUS |...
|===
You edited event 1 only. Now the set of recurring events have different fields.


`edit 2 v/NTU -a`:
|===
|1. Name: Event| Venue: NTU |...
|2. Name: Event| Venue: NTU |...
|3. Name: Event| Venue: NTU |...
|===
Different fields of first event will be overwritten by fields of the second event as identified by the INDEX used in the command .

:sectnums:


=== Listing all events : `list`

Shows a list of all events in the scheduler. +
Format: `list` +
Aliases: `lis` OR `li` OR `l` +
_Coming in V1.4: Command format can be typed case-insensitive_


=== Locating events by event name: `find`

Finds events whose event names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` +
Aliases: `fin` OR `fi` OR `f` in place of `find` +
_Coming in V2.0: Command format can be typed case-insensitive_

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `work` will match `Work`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Work Hard` will match `Hard Work`
* Only the event name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Work` will not match `Works`
* Events matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hard Work` will return `Work Smart`,
`Play Hard`
****

Examples:

* `find Study` +

* `list` +
// tag::delete[]
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd event in the scheduler. +

// tag::Reminder Feature[]
=== Reminder Operations: `addReminder` `deleteReminder` `postponeReminder`
Customised commands to add, delete reminders incrementally, and postpone all reminders for the event. +

If you have set reminder for an event, a window will pop up at the specified duration before event start time. +
You can find event name, venue, start and end time information in the pop up window. +
Eg: If you set 30min for an event that starts at 11:00, a window will pop up at 10:30 (+-1min) if the app is open. +

General Format: +
`addReminder/ deleteReminder INDEX [re/REMINDER_TIME]... [-a | -u]`. +
`postponeReminder INDEX [re/REMINDER_TIME] [-a | -u]`. (multiple durations not allowed) +
At most 1 option (either `-a` or `-u`) can exists at any one time. +
For the correct format for time, please refer to <<Reminder time format>>. +

You may choose to use `add` or `edit` command to set this field with prefix `re`. +
Please refer to  <<Adding an event : `add`>> and <<Editing an event : `edit`>> command. +

****
* If you have not set any reminder for the event, the event card will display as "No Reminder".
* When you open the app, it will NOT pop up past reminders since the last time you close the app. +
Eg. If you open the app at 11am, the reminder at 10am will not pop up when you open the app.
* When you add/edit reminder times, past reminders will be displayed on the event card but will not pop up. +
Eg. you add a reminder that is supposed to pop up an hour ago, the duration will still be displayed on the event card but will never pop up since the reminder time has already passed.
* When the reminder pops up, the reminder time displayed will not be deleted.
****

[WARNING]
=====
The reminder commands follow the same logic as `edit`. +
If your repeating events have different fields, using `-a | -u` options will overwrite individuality. +
i.e. different fields of other repeating events will be replaced by the fields of event identified by the index. +
For detailed explanations, refer to <<Editing an event : `edit`>>.
=====

==== Add reminders to event: `addReminder`
Add new reminders to events incrementally +
Format: `addReminder INDEX [re/REMINDER_TIME]... [-a | -u]`. At most 1 option (either `-a` or `-u`) can exists at any one time.

Examples:

* `addReminder 1 re/30M` +
Add a reminder 30min before Event 1 start time
* `addReminder 1 re/30M -a` +
Add a reminder 30min before start time for all repeating events of Event 1.

[NOTE]
=====
* If Event 1 already has reminders at 30m, 1h before the start time, and you want to add another 2h reminder, the following commands are equivalent: +
`edit 1 re/30m re/1h re/2h` = `addReminder 1 re/2h`
* If you add a duration that already exists in the event, it will have no effect.
=====

==== Delete reminders from event: `deleteReminder`
Delete reminders of events if it exists +
Format: `deleteReminder INDEX [re/REMINDER_TIME]... [-a | -u]`. At most 1 option (either `-a` or `-u`) can exists at any one time. +

[TIP]
====
To avoid unexpected behavior, please enter the exact duration displayed in the event card.
====

Examples:

* `deleteReminder 1 re/30M` +
Delete a reminder 30min before Event 1 start time if the reminder exists.
* `addReminder 1 re/30M re/1H -a` +
Delete reminders 30min and 1h before start time for all repeating events of Event 1 if the reminders exist.

[NOTE]
=====
* If Event 1 already has reminders at 30m, 1h, 2h before the start time, and you want to delete the 1h reminder, the following commands are equivalent: +
  `edit 1 re/30m re/2h` = `deleteReminder 1 re/1h`
* If you delete a duration that does not exist in the event, it will have no effect.
=====

==== Postpone all reminders for event: `postponeReminder`
Postpone all reminders for events. If the postpone duration is larger than the original duration, reminder duration will become 0S.
Format: `postponeReminder INDEX [re/REMINDER_TIME] [-a | -u]`. At most 1 option (either `-a` or `-u`) can exists at any one time. +

[TIP]
====
Please enter only ONE duration to postpone here.
====

Examples:

* Event 1 has reminders 30min, 1H before the start time. +
`postponeReminder 1 re/5M` +
Reminders displayed become: 25min, 55min.

* Event 1 has reminders 30min, 1H before the start time. +
`postponeReminder 1 re/2H` +
Reminders displayed become: 0S. Reminders will pop up right at the start time.

[NOTE]
=====
* If the identified event has no reminders, it will have no effect.

// tag::EnterGoogleCalendarMode[]
=== EnterGoogleCalendarMode : `EnterGoogleCalendarMode`
Initialize the app. The followings are done: Pull events from your Google Calendar (login required) and add them to local calendar. +
Format: `EnterGoogleCalendarMode`
Note that you shall NOT type any extra input after the command word `EnterGoogleCalendarMode`. behavior is not guaranteed.

[NOTE]
====
For now, those events downloaded from Google will be regarded as *purely local* Events. Commands on them will only have local effects, no real-time effects on the original events on Google Calendar.
They will be suppported in v2.0.
====

As a normal user (new user who does not understand the implementation of the app), you should not modify the data files or tokens manually, such edits would lead to various errors and exceptions. +

By default, that is, before initializarion (before a normal user enters the `EnterGoogleCalendarMode`), the app is in Offline Mode. That means all command effects are local. The app does not attempt to connect to the internet. +

When the user types the command `EnterGoogleCalendarMode`, then a pop up windows will appear in your default browser for you to log in your google account.

*Log-ins*
Take note that you will be requried to log in twice.
- log-in for estabishing the link between the app and your google calendar. This is log-in from the webpage pop-up in your default browser. *This log-in credential is stored locally in your computer* Normally, you shall not swtch to another account. If you do want to switch, please close the app and delete the `StoredCredential` file. A more user-friendly command will be supported in v2.0.

- log-in for viewing the Google Calendar on the right panel. This is log-in from the webpage on the right panel. *Note that the cookies are not stored. You will be required to log in again if you close the app*

[NOTE]
====
Note for Log-In Process
====
****
After the pop-up windonw appear, you shall enter your account number and password. +
You shall not close the log in page. +
If you have done so, the app is very like to become inactive and unable to accept any command. +

Solution: +
- You should try to enter the command again.

If the problem persists, try the following: +

- close the app and delete the `StoredCredential` file in your `token` folder found in the root folder.
- make sure the content of `mode.txt` file is `Disabled`. Note that this file shall NOT be deleted at any time. If it is missing, the app is likely to have unexpected bebavior.
****

[NOTE]
====
Note for two-factor authentication (2FA) of your Google Account
====
****
The app might able / not able to support your 2FA log in method, depends on the security level set by you.
If the internet is not good, the log in page might not appear.
****

Below is the guide for the log-in process.

[NOTE]
====
This command will have to access your Google Calendar data, Google authentication is required.
====

****
Step 1: If you have not sucesfuuly logged into our application using `EnterGoogleCalendarMode` before, a pop-up login window will appear in your default browser.

Step 2:

- You will be required to log in your Google account, just like when you are using many other Google services.
- After successful authorization, the message +
`Received verification code. You may now close the window.` +
will appear.

Step 3:

- The application proceeds automatically after successful authorization. +
- As instructed, you do not have to do anything else so please do feel free to close the browser tab.

Step 4:

- The application then proceeds with the pulling of Google Calendar events, and trying to add them to local database.
- A success message appears after the completion of addition of supported events.

Note that if Google service is not stable, the limit of the IP address/account is reached or there are too many events. The command might not able to retrieve any event.
Also, when Google receives too frequent command, the account/IP address might be locked but no error is shown to user. +

Only single events and repeated events with single repeat date with a 'Repeat Until' date are supported.
****

[NOTE]
====
Note for concurrent usage of same account
====
****
Note that your Google Account used for this app should only be one single user. We do not support multiple people using the same account.

If more than one person is using the account, there might be more events showed in the calendar panel on the right compared to the left panel. The real time effec is only for local commands, commands entered from anywhere else (except from the app you are using right now) are not captured in the app and hence no effects.
****

[NOTE]
====
Note for using multiple account in the app
====
****
This is not supported. Switching of account is also not supported. +

For advcaned user, if you do want to switch, please close the app and delete the `StoredCredential` file. +
However the behaviour is not guranteed.

A more user-friendly command will be supported in v2.0.
****

*Note for different implementation of our app and Google*
Note that this version is still v1.4 while we are not able to fully understand the implementation of Google Calendar on their side. +

We can *only guarantee the command sent from the app is the same as intended*. However, we are not able to gurantee how Google interprete the command, and how they implement the bebavior of the command. It is expeccted to see differnet behaviors. That being said, we have tried as much as possible to ensure similar behavior.

Below is an example of different implementation.
- For an event across differnet days. Locally is shown as one item. Google's way of showing it might seem like multiple items because the start time and end time is not shown.

Local Display:

Google Display:

- For repeatUntil date, Google implements it differently and we are not able to fully understand it.


*Note for Select Command*
`Select` command is partially depreciated in this version. Selecting an event will not have any useful result, but only refresh the right panel.

*Note for Event Description*
This feature is partially depreciated in this version. Description is not shown in the app.

*Note for Single non repeat Event*
Such type of event shall not have a `RepeatUntil`,`RepeatType` field/attribute, and you shall not edit those fields as well. Behavior is not guaranteed.

*Note for Tag*
Not supported for syc with Google in this verion.

*Note for Auto-refreshing of webpage on the right panel*
This web panel's behavior is not guaranteed because it is much depend on your local set up. It may or may not auto-refresh. Please right click and refresh it. Alternatively, you can move keyboard to move to another Event, the webpage will be refreshed.
When you do not see expected outcome, please ensure your webpage is re-freshed.

*Note for Commands on Events already passed (before current time)*
Due to Google's optimization, effect of commands on such events is not guaranteed.


When you are offline, no effects on Google Calendar and command effects are only local.
Depends on your internet quality, the command might not work as intended. Special locations such as school, dormitory and hotel, the firewall might affect our app. We are able to capture some error and report as `Warning: Internet Error/Status File Does Not Exist.` or `Only local changes` or `no effects on your Google Calender`. However, due to the complex Internet enviroment, we might not able to capture all internet connection problem.+

If your internet quality is bad, the app could report above error as well. Please try your command again when the quality improves.
