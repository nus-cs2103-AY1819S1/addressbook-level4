== Introduction

MakanBook is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app to search for restaurants within NUS to eat at alone or with friends*. More importantly, MakanBook is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). MakanBook also allows users to add and manage friends and groups, start private and public jios, see which jios fit your NUS timetable and so much more! Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
