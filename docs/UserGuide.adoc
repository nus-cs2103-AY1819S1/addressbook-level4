 *use the computer frequently* and *commute by driving*, you would find our application useful in helping you obtain
 various information about car parks.

parameter which can be used as `query p/760397`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `filter [f/] [n/] [ct/CARPARK_TYPE]` can be used as `filter f/ n/ ct/SURFACE
` or as `filter f/`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `filter [f/] [n/] [ct/CARPARK_TYPE]`,
`filter [n/] [f/] [ct/CARPARK_TYPE]` is also acceptable.
