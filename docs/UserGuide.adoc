== Introduction

EventsPlus+ is for the busy university student who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts and planning ad-hoc events*. EventsPlus+ aims to simplify some of the more time-consuming administrative tasks such as coordinating location and date of ad-hoc events using a *Command Line Interface* (CLI).

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `eventsPlus+.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 f/SDE` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
`p/PHONE_NUMBER...` can be used as `p/98765432`, `p/98765432 p/88888888` etc. (i.e. 1 or many times)
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Items in curly brackets are considered to be an entity. The rules outside the curly brackets apply to the entity as a whole.
e.g. `{group/GROUP_NAME i/1 INDEX}...` can be used as `group/CS2103_Group1 i/1 group/CS2013_Group2 i/3`

Executing `addEventTag t/MEETING t/meeting` will only result in the first tag being added.
Executing `addEventTag t/MEETING` again will not be successful, as the tag already exists in the system.

[TIP]
====
* Event dates should be in the format YYYY-MM-DD

e.g. In the screenshot below, the event named "Meeting" is the 1st event on the date 2018-04-01,
hence the command `deleteEvent d/2018-04-01 i/1` will delete this event. +
The event named "Lecture" is the 2nd event on the date 2018-10-18,
hence the command `deleteEvent d/2018-10-18 i/2` will delete this event.
