== Introduction

Hallper is a desktop app for the JCRC that allows *for better and faster management of residents' contacts*. More importantly, Hallper is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Hallper can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start
