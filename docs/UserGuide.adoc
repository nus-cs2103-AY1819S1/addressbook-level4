== Introduction

CAPTracker is for students who wants to use a desktop app for calculating and
managing their CAP (Cumulative Average Point). More importantly CAPTracker is
*optimized for those who prefer to work with a CLI (Command Line Interface)*
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can
type fast, CAPTracker is the ideal application for calculating your current CAP,
and predicting grades needed to achieve your ideal CAP in modules that hasn't
been taken. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `10` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `captracker.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you would want to use as the home folder for
your CAP Tracker.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few
seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. Typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some commands you can try:

* `add -m CS2103 -y 2 -s 1 -c 4 -g A+` : Adds a module `CS2103` worth
`4` MCs taken in Semester `1` as a Year `2` student.
* `delete -t CS2103 -e 2 -z 1` : Deletes `CS2103` taken in year `2` semester
`1` from CAPTracker.
* *`exit`* : Exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

//end::commandadjust[]

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

CAPTracker data are saved in the hard disk automatically whenever there is a
command that leads to change in the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

=== Understanding the User Interface
Understanding the User Interface can be tricky - what do all the different colours mean? How do I
know what has been saved or not? Where can I see new modules I've added?

* To view new modules you've added, scroll down to the bottom of the pannel that you have categorized your
module under; either the 'Completed Modules' panel on the left, or the 'Incomplete Modules' panel on the
right. Your new entry should be at the bottom of these lists.

* Understanding the colours. The grades of modules in the 'Completed Modules' panel on the left
are circled in GREEN. This indicates that this particular module has already been taken and this is
a grade that the user does not need to worry about; it is in the past.
The grades in the the 'Incomplete Modules' panel on the right  are circled in RED. This indicates
that this particular module has not been taken and that the grade displayed in this RED circle is
not certain. It is a grade that the user needs to be aware of as it's outcome will impact the
users overall CAP score.

== FAQ

*Q*: I entered the wrong grade into my module. How do I change it? +
*A*: Use the `edit` command to input the correct information for the module +
`edit -t MODULE_CODE -g ACTUAL_GRADE`
//tag::ambersFAQ[]
*Q*: I entered the year I took my module, 2018, and it doesn't work. Why not?

*A*: The year of the module in CAPTracker doesn't refer to the calander year, but
instead the year that you are studying at. For example, a module taken in your
second year of study would have a year value of 2.


*Q*: I entered a new module but can't see it in the app. Where is it?

*A*: New modules you have added will appear at the bottom of the list in either
the 'Completed Modules' list or the 'Incomplete Modules' list depending on your
specification. Scroll down to the bottom of these lists to find your new module;
it may not appear without you scrolling if there are already a number of mdoules
entered!


*Q*: Why does my CAP goal say 'Impossible'?

*A*: Whether or not the users CAP goal is achievable is based on the grades of
completed modules and the number of incomplete modules the user has entered. If
the completed modules do not have sufficient grades to meet the CAP goal, try to
add some modules you are planning to take; it may be that you need an A+ is four
other modules before your CAP goal can be achieved. It is also based on the
adjustments made by the user. For example, if the user originally enters


*Q*: I made the wrong adjustment to a module...how do I remove the adjustment
I made?

*A*: To remove an incorrect adjustment, you need to delete that module (see
delete command chapter 3.4) and add it back in with the desired/correct
adjustments. A direct solution will be implemented in v2.0
