== Introduction

Cow is an application for those who prefer to use a desktop app for
managing tasks and contacts. It is optimized for those who prefer to
work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Cow can
get your contact and task management done faster than traditional GUI
apps.

== Quick Start

1.  Ensure you have JRE 9 or later installed.
2.  Download the latest `.jar` file link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
3.  Place it in the folder where you want the data files to be stored.
4.  Double-click the `.jar` file to start the app. The GUI should appear
in a few seconds

+
5.  Type in a command and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. For a start, type
`help` and press kbd:[Enter] to see the help page.
6.  Some example commands you can try:
* `contacts list` : lists all contacts
* `contacts add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/friends t/owesMoney`: adds contact named `John Doe` to Cow
* `tasks list` : lists all tasks
* `tasks delete 2` : deletes the 2nd task shown in the list
* `exit` : exits Cow

[WARNING]
Ensure that your screen resolution is at least 1200x800, or the calendar
might not show properly.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
e.g. in `contacts add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as
`contacts add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used
as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero
times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as
`\` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies
`n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

[TIP]
When `INDEX` is a parameter, it refers to the index of the item shown on the task or person list.

[NOTE]
Don't worry about having friends or tasks with the same name -- just add them and Cow will process them correctly.

=== Viewing help: `help`

Format: `help`

[TIP]
Besides this help page, running a command with the wrong format will also show
you how to use the command properly.

[NOTE]
The help page will be shown in another window, but you can resize and move it
around. This can be useful to refer to when using the app.
