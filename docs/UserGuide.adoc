[[Features-Notify]]
=== Enabling Notification : `notify`

[IMPORTANT]
====


* Enabling notification requires you to have already {sourceDir}/UserGuide.html#Features-Select[selected a car park].
* If you have not done so, please look at how to {sourceDir}/UserGuide.html#Features-Find[find car parks by location]
and {sourceDir}/UserGuide.html#Features-Filter[filter them through the use of flags].
* Also, {sourceDir}/UserGuide.html#Features-Query[click here] if you have forgotten how to
use the `query` command to get a list of car parks.
====

After selecting a car park, you can choose to receive notifications on how many parking lots are still available.
It sends an update periodically, so once it is enabled you do not need to type the command again into the _Command Box_.

[[notifyformat]]

which car park needs to be updated.
* You can set within a range of _10 to 600 seconds_ (10 minutes). *Decimal values are not allowed.*

'''

a change in parking lots availability through visual updates like
[underline]#<<notifynochange, these messages above>># and [underline]#<<zy_notify_ba>>#.

==== Example: Turn off notification
