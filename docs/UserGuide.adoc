== Welcome to MeNUS
link:{repoURL}[MeNUS] empowers you to improve the **m**anagement and its **e**fficiency of your restaurants in **NUS**.

Introducing link:{repoURL}[MeNUS], a revolutionary restaurant management desktop application that is *optimized for
users who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI)*. If you can type fast, link:{repoURL}[MeNUS] allows you to manage core aspects of your restaurants --
accounts (i.e. employees), menus, ingredients, sales and reservations management -- all within a single application!

`{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Italian`, `t/Italian t/Wednesday` etc.

 is also acceptable.

=== Sales Management

The following are sales-related commands to help you with financial tracking and analysis. The terms **"sales record"**
and **"record list"** will be used frequently under this section so it is advisable to first understand their
definition in the <<sales-record, glossary>>.

[[record-sales]]
==== Recording sales volume of an item: `record-sales` or `rs`

Records the sales volume of an item within a specific day into the record list. +
Format: `record-sales d/DATE n/ITEM_NAME q/QUANTITY_SOLD p/ITEM_PRICE` or `rs d/DATE n/ITEM_NAME q/QUANTITY_SOLD
p/ITEM_PRICE` +

****
* `DATE` must be written in the DD-MM-YYYY format.
* `DATE` must exist in the calendar.
* Both `DATE` and `ITEM_NAME` cannot be same as another record in the record list.
* `ITEM_NAME` is case insensitive. "Cheesy Pasta" and "cheesy pasta" are regarded as the same item.
****

Examples:

* `record-sales d/25-09-2018 n/Fried Rice q/35 p/5.50`
* `rs d/25-09-2018 n/Fried Rice q/35 p/5.50`

[[auto-ingredient-update]]
**Auto-ingredient update mechanism**

`record-sales` also determines all the ingredients you used and automatically deducts them from the ingredient
list, subjected to the following conditions: +
1) The item exists in the menu. +
See <<add-item, Section 5.4.1, “Adding an item to the menu">> for more information. +
2) The required ingredients to make one unit of `ITEM_NAME` is specified. +
See <<add-required-ingredient, Section 5.4.14, “Add required ingredients">> for more information. +
3) All required ingredients exist in the ingredient list. +
See <<add-ingredient, Section 5.3.1, “Adding an ingredient">> for more information. +
4) There are sufficient ingredients to make `QUANTITY_SOLD` units of `ITEM_NAME`. +
See <<stockup, Section 5.3.6, “Stocking up an ingredient">> for more information.

[NOTE]
====
Sales volume will still be recorded even if some of the above conditions are not met. However, ingredient list
will not be updated
====

[NOTE]
====
[[ingredients-used]]**Ingredient used**: MeNUS will remember the name and quantity of ingredients you used as long as
the item and its required ingredients have been specified in the menu component
====

[TIP]
====
If you recorded a sales volume by mistake, you can use the `Undo` command to recover the deducted ingredients,
provided that the ingredients have been deducted automatically
====
