== Introduction

Flashbook is for those who prefer to use a desktop app to manage their to-do for university. Flashbook is *designed for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users who can type fast can navigate and use the to-do list faster than traditional GUI apps. Makes your hand itchy and want to try out? Go to <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `flashbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Flash Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : Display all existing tasks on the display.
* **`add`**`n this add high Problem_5.12 with deadline on 100918: the most difficult one` : adds a task named `Problem_5.12` to the FlashBook and set the deadline of the task to due on `10/08/18`.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in square brackets are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `changeto [tag] with [TaskParameters]`, `TaskParameters` and `tag` are parameters which can be used as `changeto urgent with deadline on 110918`.
* Words in square brackets are optional. e.g. `changeto [tag] with [TaskParameters]` can be used as `changeto with deadline on 110918` or `changeto urgent`

====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Adding a new task: `add`

Add a new task named [Task Name] with parameters described in [Task Parameters] to the module [Module Name]. +
Format: `in [Module Name] add [Tag] [Task Name] with [Task Parameters]:[Description]`

[NOTE]
If Module Name is “this” or “&”, the new task will be added as a subtask of the selected task

.Possible tags are:
* urgent / u
* high / h

* low / l
* done / d (this task will not show up in the find command unless specified)

* `in this add high Problem_5.12 with deadline on 100918: the most difficult one`
* `#& a h Problem_5.12 dl100918: the most difficult one`

[NOTE]
[Task Name] must be a string without spaces and is not a restricted keyword.

=== Editing a task : `changeto`
****
Pre-condition: Task is already selected using `select` command. +
****
Replace the selected tasks’ parameters with those described in this command (undescribed parameters will not be changed) +

Format: `changeto [Tag] with [TaskParameters]:[TaskDescription]`, or the shorthand `c [Tag] w [Taskparameters]:[TaskDescription]`

Examples:

* `changeto urgent with deadline on 150918: only ten pages is needed` +
Edits task selected to be of `urgent` tag and deadline on `15/09/18`, with task description of `only ten pages is needed`.
* `ct u w dl120918` +
Edit task selected tagging it with `urgent` and set its deadline to `12/09/18`
* `changeto with deadline on 110918: deadline extended` +
Edit task selected deadline to `11/09/18`

=== Deleting a task: `delete/del`
****
Pre-condition: Task is already selected using select command
****
Remove the selected task. +
Format: `delete`, or the shorthand `del`


=== Managing the module list: modules

Management of modules in FlashBook. Capabilities of FlashBook module system includes:

- Create a module: `modules create [Module Name]`, or `+\#[Module Name]`
- Delete a module: `modules delete [Module Name]`, or `~#[Module Name]`
- List modules: `modules`, or `#`
- List tasks in the module: `modules [Module Name]`, or `#[Module Name]`
- Delete all modules: `modules delete \*` or `~*`

Examples:

* modules create CS2103T
* modules delete CS2101
* +#ST2334
* ~#CS2040
* #CS2040
* #
* ~*

`[Module Name] must be an alphanumeric string without spaces.`

=== Find a task: `find`

The `find` command searches the AddressBook for specified persons, groups, or meetings, and displays the results on
the panel. +

Syntax: +
 Longhand: `find [person|group|meeting]  *[all]/<keywords> *[some]/<keywords> *[none]/<keywords>` +
 Shorthand: `find [p|g|m] *[a]/<keyword...> *[s]/<keywords> *[n]/<keywords>` +


* `[person|group|meeting]`, `[p|g|m]`: This parameter specifies whether to search for persons, groups, or meetings.
    This parameter is required to execute this command.
    ** `person`, `p`: Specifies to search for persons.
    ** `group`, `g`: Specifies to search for groups.
    ** `meeting`, `m`: Specifies to search for meetings.
* `<keywords>`: This tag contains any number of keywords separated by a kbd:[space].
* `[all]`, `[a]`: This parameter specifies that the results must contain every keyword specified in `<keywords>`.
    This parameter may be omitted.
* `[some]`, `[s]`: This parameter specifies that the results must contain at least one keyword specified in `<keywords>`.
    This parameter may be omitted.
* `[none]`, `[n]`: This parameter specifies that the results must not contain any keyword specified in `<keywords>`.
    This parameter may be omitted.





The “then” keyword:

If “then [Command]”  is inserted after find, the [Command] will be applied to all results of the find command.
[Command] can be replaced with either changeto, delete, or markdone.

Thus it is possible to run commands like
“in CS2101 findwhere then delete” to delete every task under CS2101

=== Sort the list: `sort`

Sorts the current displayed list based on the given property. +
Format: `sort [TODO]` +


=== Selecting a task : `select`

****
Pre-condition: user already list all available tasks using  find/findwhere command
Select and displays a task from the list obtained using find
****

Format: `“select [index]” or “s[index]” when [index] is a positive integer (starts from 1)`

****
* This also display all subtasks of the selected task.
  If a task is already on display, this command instead select a subtask from the displayed tasks’ list of subtasks.
****


=== Going back to the parent task : `back / b`

If the selected task is a subtask, go back to the parent task of this subtask.

=== Listing all tasks : `list`

Display all existing tasks on the display.

=== Marking the selected task as done: `markdone / md`

*Pre-condition:* Task is already selected using select command

Change the tag the selected task to “done”.
To reverse this, find and select the task then use the changeto command

=== Import Persons : `import`

Import FlashBook or any AddressBook-level4. +

****
FlashBook is backward compatible to AddressBook-level4. +

This means that users of AddressBook-level4 are able to upgrade to use FlashBook by just importing their AddressBook-level4 storage file. +
****
Format: `import f/<relative filepath>`

Example:
`import f/flashBookBackUp.xml` : import `flashBookBackUp.xml` into FlashBook.
`import f/addressBookBackUp.xml` : import `addressBookBackUp.xml` into FlashBook even if the imported file is Addressbook and not FlashBook.

=== Export Persons : `export`

Export FlashBook as backup elsewhere. +
Format: +
`export f/<filepath>`

Example:
`export f/backup.xml` : Export FlashBook as `backup.xml`.

== Change Storage Location: `filepath`

Change the storage location of FlashBook.
Format: +
`filepath f/<filepath>`

Example:
`filepath f/new_path.xml` : Storage location of FlashBook is now stored at `new_path.xml`.

****
User can also check the current path of Flashbook use `filepath show`
****


=== Autocomplete

To assist user to speed up typing of command, user can <TAB> to autocomplete the command.

=== Saving the data

Flashbook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.

// tag::dataencryption[]
