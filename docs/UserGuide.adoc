By: `Team T12-3`      Since: `Sep 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

This User Guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for new-users of the Student Schedule Planner (SSP). This
walkthrough includes instructions on how to install the latest version of java, as well as downloading and running
the SSP application.

Student Schedule Planner (SSP) is a desktop application created by Team T12-3. It is a planner customised for university
students, and it aims to help university students manage their time effectively.

SSP incorporates features that streamline the creation, organisation, and finding of tasks. In addition, it
allows the user to keep track of the current academic week, and has a progress tracking feature, which displays the
user's progress.

Instead of utilising a conventional Graphical User Interface(GUI). SSP is optimised for users who prefer typing out
their commands. This application has the potential to be much faster than regular planner applications, especially for
users who are proficient in typing. Move on to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.

== Quick Start
.  Install Java `9` if you do not yet have it installed. It is available
 https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here]. +
[WARNING]
The application may not run correctly on Java `10` or Java `11`.

.  Download the latest `studentscheduleplanner.jar` link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-3/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder that you want to use as the home folder for your planner.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.Main menu for the SSP application upon starting the app.

.  Type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing [blue]`help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features
*Understanding the command format*

- Parameters can be in any order: +
====
[blue]`n/NAME d/DEADLINE`

[blue]`d/DEADLINE
n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

* Words in [blue]`UPPER_CASE` represent parameters to be entered by the user: +

====
[blue]`add n/NAME`

[blue]`n/NAME` represents the task name which the user inputs, such as [blue]`n/CS2103 Tutorial`.
====

* Items in square brackets are optional: +
====
[blue]`n/NAME t/[TAG]`

The parameter [blue]`t/[TAG]` is optional, which means [blue]`n/CS2103 tutorial
t/CS2100`, and [blue]`n/CS2103 tutorial` are both valid commands.
====

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times: +
====
[blue]`t/[TAG]...`

Allows for multiple tags to be input: [blue]`t/tutorial`,
 [blue]`t/tutorial t/CS2100` etc.
====

[WARNING]
Please take note that naming is case-sensitive in Student Schedule Planner. For example, `cats` and `Cats` are
considered different. This applies to task, tag as well as category. Only [blue]`find` and [blue]`filter` commands
are case-insensitive for keywords.

=== Viewing Help

Opening the user guide page is as follows. +
====
[blue]`help` +
====

=== Adding a Task

Add a task to the schedule planner. +
====
[blue]`add n/NAME p/PRIORITYLEVEL t/[TAG] d/DEADLINE v/VENUE` +
====
Example: +
====
[blue]`add n/exam p/3 t/CS3241 d/101018 v/mpsh1`

Adds a task named `exam` with priority level `3`,
tag `CS3241` and deadline of `101018` , venue at `mpsh1`.
====
The priority level must be a number between 1 to 3, where 3 denotes highest priority.


[WARNING]
Duplicate tasks are not allowed in Student Schedule Planner; two tasks are considered identical if they
have same name, deadline date, tags, and venue. If two tasks have same attributes except for priority,
they are still considered as identical.
Please take note that task name is case-sensitive. For example, task name `study` and `Study` are
considered different.


[NOTE]
The priority value must be a number between 1 to 3, where 3 denotes highest priority.

[NOTE]
As we have implemented auto-sorting, if you add a task, it might get reordered in the task
list. For more details about auto-sorting, please refer to <<Sorting Tasks by Deadline Date and Priority>>

[WARNING]
Name, Priority, Deadline, and Venue fields are compulsory, and therefore required for every task. Tags are optional.

[TIP]
When you add tasks with new tags (tags that have not been added to any existing categories),
these tags will be automatically added to default category `Others`. For details about Category and Tags, refer to
<<Adding a Category>> and <<Adding a Tag to a Category>>.
When you add new tasks with new tags (tags that have not been added to any existing categories),
these tags will be automatically added to default category `Others`. For detailed guide about category and tags,
please refer to <<Adding a Category>> and <<Adding a Tag to a Category>>.

// tag::addrepeat[]

=== Adding a Recurring Task

Add tasks that occur in regular intervals. +
====
[blue]`repeat r/REPEATS i/INTERVAL n/NAME p/PRIORITYLEVEL t/[TAG] d/DEADLINE v/VENUE` +
====
Example: +
====
[blue]`repeat r/4 i/7 n/CS2103T Tutorial p/3 t/Tutorial d/111018 v/COM1-0210`

Adds 4 tasks named [blue]`CS2103T Tutorial` with priority level [blue]`3`,
tag [blue]`Tutorial`, venue at [blue]`COM1-0210`, and deadlines on the 11th October 2018, 18th October 2018, 25th October 2018, and 1st November 2018.


The diagram below illustrates the SSP before and after the above command was entered:

image::beforeafteraddrepeat.png[width="800"]
====
[NOTE]
The number of repeats should be a positive integer (≥1). Setting the repeat as 1 has the same
effect as using the `add` command.
The number of repeats should be an integer that is greater or equals to 1. Setting the repeat as 1 has the same effect as using the [blue]`add` command.

[TIP]
Use this command to schedule tasks that you carry out regularly.

[WARNING]
The maximum number of repetitions is 15.

[CAUTION]
Tasks whose deadlines go beyond 2099 will have their deadlines set to the 21st century instead. For example, a task
created by the AddRepeatCommand that with the deadline on 1st January 2101 will instead have the  deadline set to 1st
 January 2001 instead.

// end::addrepeat[]

=== Editing a Task

Edit an existing task in the schedule planner. +
====
[blue]`edit INDEX n/[NAME] p/[PRIORITYLEVEL] t/[TAGS]... d/[DEADLINE] v/[VENUE]`
====
Example:

====
[blue]`edit 3 p/1 d/121019` +

The task at index `3` will have it's priority value changed to [blue]`1` , and its deadline is changed to
[blue]`121019`.
====

[blue]`INDEX` refers to the number shown beside each task name in the displayed task list. Refer to the task
according to its index number.
The [blue]`INDEX` *must be a positive integer* (≥1)

The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. Refer to the task according to the index number.
The `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

[CAUTION]
At least one of the optional fields must be provided. Existing values of provided field
will be updated to the input values.

[WARNING]
Duplicate tasks are not allowed in Student Schedule Planner; two tasks are considered identical if they
have same name, deadline date, tags, and venue. If two tasks have same attributes except for priority,
they are still considered as identical.
Please take note that task name is case-sensitive. For example, task name `study` and `Study` are
considered different.

[NOTE]
As we have implemented auto-sorting, if you edited `date` or `priority`, the task might get reordered in the task
list. For more detailed guide about auto-sorting, please refer to <<Sorting Tasks by Deadline Date and Priority>>

[WARNING]
Existing tags of a task will be removed when its tag is edited. If input is
[blue]`edit 3 t/project`, then the resulting tag(s) of task 3 will be `project` only.

[TIP]
To remove all tags of an existing task e.g for task with index number `3`, you can type [blue]`edit 3 t/`, all the
tags of the task of index number `3` will be removed.

=== Deleting a Task

//tag::sorting[]
=== Viewing Tasks in the Order of Deadline Date and Priority
All tasks are automatically loaded in the order of deadlines except for archived tasks.
The order of tasks first depends on deadline date, then priority. +
Given below is an example of two tasks with different deadline dates.
Task `Do CS2030 lab` is listed before task `Self study` because it has
earlier deadline date.

image::sortingdate.png[width="300"]

=== Sorting Tasks by Deadline Date and Priority

All tasks are sorted chronologically by default. The order of tasks first depends on deadline date, then priority. +

Given below is an example of two tasks with different deadlines.
Task [blue]`Do CS2030 lab` is listed before task [blue]`Self study` because it has
earlier deadline.

image::sortingdate.png[width="400" caption="Figure 1. "]

If two tasks have the same deadline, then the order depends on priority, one that has
higher priority will appear before one that has lower priority. 3 is the highest priority, while 1 is the lowest. +
Given below is an example of two tasks with the same deadline dates.


image::sortingpriority.png[width="300"]

[WARNING]
Please take note that archived tasks are not shown in order.

//end::sorting[]

=== Finding Tasks by Name

Find tasks whose names match with given keyword. The search is case insensitive, `apples` and  `Apples` both return

=== Generating Academic Calendar
Generate the entire academic calendar based on the first academic day and stores it in storage.

Currently, the generated academic calendar is based on the academic calender of National University of Singapore
(NUS). It may not be compatible with academic calendars from other institutions.

Whenever the application is launched within the academic calendar's dates, the application title will append that
particular week's description to the title of the application. +

====
[blue]`firstday DDMMYY`
====

Example:
====

[blue]`firstday 130818`

The following diagram illustrates when you execute [blue]`firstday 130818`, and launch the application within 121118
 - 181118 (Week 13 for NUS academic year 18/19 semester 1), the application title will be appended with "Week 13".

image::FirstDayCommand_UG_Before_After.png[width="500"]
====

[NOTE]
There would not be any visible changes upon using the command. The changes are only reflected after relaunching the
application.

`DDMMYY` refers to the date format of day, month and year. It must fulfil the following criteria:

1. `DDMMYY` must only be one set of value such as `130818`. Value such as `130818 200818` or `130818 20`
will be rejected as they are considered as more than one set of date.

2. `DDMMYY` must be a valid date within 21st century.

3. `DDMMYY` must be a Monday.

`Steam shopping list` are all valid category names. +


`Modules` and `Others` are two categories exist by default.

[WARNING]
Please take note that category is case-sensitive. For example, category `cats` and category `Cats` are
considered different.

[WARNING]
Duplicated categories are not allowed in schedule planner. All
categories must have different names.

[TIP]
All non-default categories (categories except `Modules` and `Others` can be removed.
For detailed guide about how to remove categories, please refer to <<Deleting a Category>>.

[TIP]
All non-default categories (categories except `Modules` and `Others` can be renamed.

=== Adding Tags to Categories
Add a tag to a selected existing category.
====
[blue]`addtag c/CATEGORY t/TAG`
====

Example:
====
[blue]`addtag c/Steam shopping list t/Overwatch`

image::addtag.png[width="300"]
====

[WARNING]
Duplicated tags are not allowed under same category. +
For instance, in above example, you cannot add another tag `Overwatch`
to category `Steam shopping list`. However you can save same tag under multiple categories.
Please take note that naming of tag is case-sensitive. For example, tag name `cat` and `Cat`
are considered different.

[TIP]
When you add new tasks with new tags (tags that have not been added to any existing categories),
these tags will be automatically added to default category `Others`.

[TIP]
For how to remove tags from categories, please refer to <<Clearing a Category>>.
//end::addingtag[]

//tag::clearcat[]
=== Clearing a Category
Clears all tags saved under selected category.
After executing this command, the selected category will not contain any tags.

====

Example:
====
[blue]`clearcat c/Modules`

image::clearcat.png[width="300"]
====
When a category is cleared, tags saved in other categories are not affected.
For instance, in above example, if you have tag `CS2105` in category `Others`
as well, after clearing category `Modules`, tag `CS2105` will still exist in category
`Others`. +
On the other hand, if tag `CS2105` is only saved under category `Modules`, then after clearing
category `Modules`, the tag `CS2105` will be removed from schedule planner.
