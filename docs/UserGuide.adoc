*Command Format*

* All commands begin with the command word. The command word may be followed by user-defined parameters.
* According to the format of each command, words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters which can be specified by you.
** E.g. the `login` command has the format of `login u/USERNAME` where `USERNAME` is a parameter which can be replaced by a specified value. In order to log in to an account with the username "username123", enter the command `login u/username123`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional. This means that the parameter does not have to be included for the command to work.
** E.g if a command has a parameter format of `n/EXPENSE_NAME [t/TAG]`, the parameters can be used as `n/Birthday Present t/Girlfriend`, which includes the "Girlfriend" tag, or as `n/Birthday Present`, which does not include a tag.
* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.
** E.g. if a command format contains the parameter `t/TAG...`, the parameter can be replaced with `t/friend` or `t/friend t/family`
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command format specifies `n/NAME c/CATEGORY`, using the parameters `c/CATEGORY n/NAME` is also acceptable.
