== Introduction

Deadline Manager (DLM) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for keeping track of tasks*. More importantly, DLM is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, DLM can help you sort out your upcoming tasks faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your deadline manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tasks
* **`add`**`n/v1.1 milestone d/2/10/2018 t/CS2103T p/1` : adds a task named `v1.1 milestone` to the deadline manager.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Assignment 2`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Assignment 2 t/CS3230` or as `n/Assignment 2`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/CS2103`, `t/CS2103 t/Project` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DEADLINE`, `d/DEADLINE n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`
Help will list the available functions for the user to use.

Format: `help`

=== Adding a task: `add`
Adds a task to the deadline manager +
Format: `add n/NAME d/DEADLINE p/PRIORITY [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
You can ask two tasks with the same attributes!

Examples:

* `add n/Assignment 2 d/1/1/2018 p/1` +
Adds a task with name `Assignment 2` with a deadline on 1st January 2018 with priority 1 (highest priority).
