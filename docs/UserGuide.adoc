User Guide
Introduction
Vocabulary Review List is for those who prefer to use an offline version of the dictionary for learning purposes. More importantly, VRL is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, VRL can fetch the words faster than searching it on the website. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!
