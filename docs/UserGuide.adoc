== Introduction


HealthBase is for hospital administrators, doctors, nurses, and pharmacists who prefer to use a desktop app to manage patients and their associated data.
More importantly, HealthBase is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, HealthBase can get your hospital management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure that your computer has Java version `9` or later installed.
.  Download the latest release of our application, `healthbase.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your HealthBase.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
(The command box is shown in Fig. 1 above; it is the gray box with the words "Enter your commands here..." inside.)

Some example commands you can try:

* *`exit`* : exits the app
* *`select 1`* : selects the first patient (Alex Yeoh in the image above) in the list of patients.

Refer to <<Features>> for the details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

TIP: Features are sorted by their command word in lexicographical order.

| Medication | Yes | The columns of the table in the view, one-indexed.
| Medical History | Yes | The columns of the table in the view, one-indexed.
|=======================================================================

Example(s):

* `sort a 123` where the current view is Medication
** Sorts the table in the medication view by the first column (Drug Name). Any entries with the same drug name will be further sorted by the second column (Dosage), with any entries with the same drug name and dosage being further sorted by the third column (Dosage Unit).
* `sort a 1` where the current view is the default view (blank view).
