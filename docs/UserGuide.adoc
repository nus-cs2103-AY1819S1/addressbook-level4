== Introduction

TutorPal is for private tutors who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing students information*. More importantly, TutorPal is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). TutorPal is a great tool to track students' academic performance and schedule. Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `Tutor Pal.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Tutor Pal.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 el/Primary 4 g/Y1819S1_Mid 89 t/friends t/owesMoney` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*


* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items,Grades in square brackets are optional. +
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items,Grades with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times or grades), `t/friend`, `g/midterm 100`, `t/friend t/family`, `g/test1 100 g/test2 99` etc.
* Grade consists of two parts, exam name and exam score.
** The name and score should be separated by space.
** Score should be between 0 and 100.
** Considering the grades are just some records, the APP didn't implement the delete function temporarily. If you input a wrong exam name, use undo to fix it.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====



=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

// tag::add[]
=== Adding a person: `add`


Adds a person to the student list +
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS el/EDUCATIONAL_LEVEL [g/GRADE]... [t/TAG]...`

****
* If the student added has exactly the same name as an existing student in the student list, new student cannot be added.
* `EDUCATIONAL_LEVEL` must be `Primary`, `Secondary` or `JC`. +
e.g. `... el/Primary ...` is valid; however, `... el/primary ...`, `... el/University ...` or other inputs like these are invalid
* The format of `GRADE` is `exam name` + `exam score`. +
e.g. `... g/mid-test 100 ...`
****


[TIP]
====
* A person can have any number of tags and grades (including 0).
* Name of the exam should be different. Otherwise, they will be considered as the same one and the APP will store the score of the last one.
====

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 el/Primary 4` +
Add a person without grade and tag.
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 el/Primary 4 g/Y1819S1_Final 100 g/Y1819S1_Mid 89 t/friends t/owesMoney` +
Add a person with one or more than one grades and tags. +
// end::add[]


// tag::edit[]
[[edit]]

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the student list. +
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [el/EDUCATIONAL_LEVEL] [g/GRADE] [t/TAG]...`


****
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed. +
i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person's tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* Edit grade will not delete the previous grades as the tap attribute. If the exam name exists already, it will cover the previous one and edit the score only.
****

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/alex@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `alex@example.com` respectively.

****

Examples:

* `exchangeTime 0 0 Alice Bob`

[NOTE]
====
The reason this command exists is that when two student want to swap time
it cannot only use edit because the existing time-slot will crush.
