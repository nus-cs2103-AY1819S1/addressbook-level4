== Introduction

PatientBook is an all-in-one convenience utility for medical professionals in Singapore. It is used to store and manage patient data as well as appointment schedules. It can also be used to retrieve information about disease, symptoms and drugs.
Patientbook uses simple and intuitive “commands” to receive instructions from the user – this makes it speedy, lightweight and easy to pick up. Refer to Section 2, “Quick Start” to begin using PatientBook.

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java version 9 or later installed on your computer. If not, the latest version of Java can be downloaded
http://www.java.com/en/download/[here].
.  Download the latest version of `patientbook.jar`
   https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-2/main/releases[here].
. Copy the downloaded file to the folder you wish to use as the home folder for PatientBook.
. Double-click the file to start PatientBook. The following GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`mode patient`* : switches to patient management mode.
* *`mode appointment`* : switches to appointment management mode.
* *`add patient n/David Lee p/99998888 a/Utown e/davlee@gmail.com`* : automatically switches to patient management mode and add patient David Lee into the patient record, with the details provided.
* *`delete patient p0`* : deletes patient with patient ID 'p0'.
* *`add appointment for Lee next week`* : automatically switches to patient management mode, and schedules an appointment for patient whose name matches Lee some time next week.
* *`delete appointment e0`* : deletes appointment with appointment ID 'e0'.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

.   Commands are, in general, case sensitive.
.   Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user. eg. in `add patient n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
.   Items in square brackets are optional. +
    eg. in `add patient [t/TAG]`, `TAG` is an optional parameter.
.   Parameters with prefixes may be specified in any order, eg. all parameters for `add patient`, such as `n/NAME` and `a/ADDRESS` can be specified in any order
.   Commands which accept only a unique value for each prefixed parameter will only accept the last one entered for each type. +
    eg. `add patient n/John n/Sally` will add a patient with the name `Sally`, and ignore `John` altogether.
====

=== View help : `help`

*Format:* `help`

Opens this user guide to display information on how to use PatientBook. Help command works in both patient management
mode and appointment management mode.

=== Switch to patient management mode : `mode patient`

*Format:* `mode patient`

Switches the application to patient management mode. In this mode, you can view and manage patients’ data. When you
enter a valid command regarding patient in appointment management mode, the application will switch to patient management
mode automatically.

.Patient Mode

=== Switch to appointment management mode : `mode appointment`

*Format:* `mode appointment`

Switches the application to appointment management mode. In this mode, you can view and manage your patient's appointments.
When you enter a valid command regarding appointment in patient management mode, the application will switch to
appointment management mode automatically.

[NOTE]
By default, the list panel only displays appointments in the future.

.Appointment Mode
image::mode_appointment.PNG[width="600"]

=== Add a patient : `add patient`

*Format:* `add patient n/NAME p/PHONE a/ADDRESS e/EMAIL [t/TAG]`

Creates a new patient record and saves it in the list of all patient records. If necessary, switches the application to patient management mode.

[NOTE]
Any number of tags may be included, or none at all.

Examples:

* `add patient n/John Smith p/90516038 a/New Smith Street, Singapore 519321 e/johnsmith@gmail.com`
* `add patient n/Alice Barker p/62353535 a/4 Pizza Road, Singapore 941023 e/alice_barker@yahoo.com.sg t/friend t/groupmate`

=== Select a patient : `select patient`

*Format:* `select patient PATIENT_ID`

Selects an existing patient and its information will display on the right. If necessary, switches the application to patient management mode.
Selecting patient replaces physically clicking an patient card. Hence, you can only select a patient that is displayed on the left.

[NOTE]
You may select a deleted patient by first typing `list patient all`.

Examples:

* `select patient p1`
* `select patient p29`

.Select a patient
image::select_command_patient.PNG[width="600"]

=== Edit patient information : `edit patient`

*Format:* `edit patient PATIENT_ID [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL] [t/TAG]`

Edits an existing patient record. If necessary, switches the application to patient management mode.

[NOTE]
At least one of the optional fields must be provided.

[TIP]
Editing tags will remove all existing tags from the patient and replace them with the new tags. To remove all tags from a patient, use `t/` without any further input after the `/`.

Example:

* `edit patient p229 n/Bob Ross p/95106202`
* `edit patient p24 t/replacedTag t/friend`
* `edit patient p510 a/New Address Road, Singapore 401914 t/`

=== List all patients : `list patient`

*Format:* `list patient [all]`

Shows a list of all patients in the patient record. Using `all` will display all patients deleted in the past. If necessary, switches the application to appointment management mode.

=== Locate patients : `find patient`

*Format:* `find patient KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

*Alternative Format:* `find patient PATIENT_ID`

Notable Behaviour:

* The search is case insensitive, eg. `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of keywords do not matter, eg. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only names in the patient record are searched
* Patients which are marked as deleted can only be found by looking up their Patient ID explicitly. They may not be found via keyword search
* Only full words will be searched, eg. `Han` will *not* match `Hans`
* Patient which match at least one of the keywords will be displayed after running the search, eg. `Hans Bo` will match `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang`
* Finding a patient via their ID will match and display patients who have the exact same ID as the search term, unless the ID is for some reason part of another patient's name, in which case they will be displayed as well

Examples:

* `find patient john`
* `find patient Alice bob`
* `find patient p510`

=== Delete a patient record : `delete patient`

*Format:* `delete patient PATIENT_ID`

[NOTE]
Patient records will only be marked as deleted, rather than being removed altogether. This is due to the sensitive nature of patient information

Examples:

* `delete patient p510`
* `delete patient p29`

=== Add an appointment : `add appointment`

*Format:* `add appointment for NAME TIME`

*Alternative Format:* `add appointment for PATIENT_ID TIME`

Creates a new appointment and places it in the schedule. If necessary, switches the application to appointment management mode.

[NOTE]
Unlike other commands, this command does not require any prefixing.

For `TIME` parameter, user may choose to use natural expressions to indicate the time or period where the appointment is to be scheduled. The list of natural expressions for `TIME` accepted by the programme include:

* `tomorrow` or `tmr`
* `the day after tomorrow` or `the day after tmr`
* `in * day` or `in * days`
* `in * week` or `in * weeks`
* `in * month` or `in * months`
* `this week` or `next week`
* `this month` or `next month`
* `this Monday` `this Tuesday` `this Wednesday` `this Thursday` `this Friday` `this Saturday` or `this Sunday`
* `next Monday` `next Tuesday` `next Wednesday` `next Thursday` `next Friday` `next Saturday` or `next Sunday`
* `soon`
* `recently`
* `in a few days`
* in `DD/MM/YYYY` format
[NOTE]
Asterisk (*) denotes any positive integer number.
[NOTE]
Adding an appointment with a time that is already past is allowed. However, this functionality should only be used when user wants to record some critical information about a past appointment that is for some reason unscheduled beforehand.

After the initial input is processed by the programme, user may encounter a maximum of four prompt windows for further input, including:

* A prompt window where user is required to choose the correct patient to schedule for, if the name provided in the initial input can be matched to multiple patients in the record. The definition of a successful match is the same as that of the command `find patient`, as explained above. `Patient_ID` of the intended patient is to be entered.
* A prompt window where user is required to provide a specific time slot for the appointment, from a list of available time periods, in `DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm - hh:mm` format.
* A prompt window where user may choose to provide any tags for the appointment.
* A prompt window where user may choose to provide any additional notes for the appointment.

Example:

Command entered: `add appointment for Xinze tomorrow`
// we require explicit numbering because the numbering system stops searching for further indices past
// a fenced code block.

1) There are multiple patients named `Xinze` in the patient record. Programme requests for a specific patient ID, in a prompt window similar to the following:

.Prompt Window for Patient ID
image::promptName.png[width="600"]

2) Once `Xinze` is matched to a unique patient in the patient record, programme displays a list of available time periods during `tomorrow`, based on the current time at which the command is executed, in another prompt window similar to the following:

.Prompt Window for Time Slot
image::promptTimeSlot.png[width="600"]

3) User further inputs: `31/10/2018 9:30 - 10:30`. Programme proceeds to request for tags to be attached to the appointment, in another prompt window similar to the following:

.Prompt Window for Tags
image::promptTag.png[width="600"]

4) User may choose to provide or not provide any tags. In this case, the user does not wish to attach any tags. After that, programme proceeds to request for additional notes for the appointment, in another prompt window similar to the following:

.Prompt Window for Additional Notes
image::promptNotes.png[width="600"]

5) User may choose to provide or not provide any additional notes. In this case, the user does not wish to add any additional notes. Upon completion, programme creates the appointment and displays the following message to the user:


```
New appointment added: Appointment ID: e3 scheduled for patient ID: p7 during: 31/10/2018 09:30 to 31/10/2018 10:30
Details:
Tags:
```
=== Select an appointment : `select appointment`

*Format:* `select appointment APPOINTMENT_ID`

Selects an existing appointment and its details will display on the right. If necessary, switches the application to appointment management mode.
Selecting appointment replaces physically clicking an appointment card. Hence, you can only select an appointment that is displayed on the left.

[NOTE]
You may select a past appointment by first typing `list appointment all`.

Examples:

* `select appointment e5`
* `select appointment e29`

.Select an appointment
image::select_command_appointment.PNG[width="600"]

=== Edit appointment information : `edit appointment`

*Format:* `edit appointment APPOINTMENT_ID [p/PATIENT_ID] [t/TIME] [d/NOTES] [s/TAG]`

Edits an existing appointment with the given field(s). The constraints of each field are the same as those of the command `add appointment`. If necessary, switches the application to appointment management mode.

[NOTE]
At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
[NOTE]
To edit the time of the appointment, `[t/TIME]` has to be entered in `DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm - hh:mm` format, as natural expressions are not supported in this command.

Examples:

* `edit appointment e1 s/SecondVisit`
* `edit appointment e1031 p/p5`
* `edit appointment e41032 t/30/10/2019 10:00 - 11:30`

=== List all appointments : `list appointment`

 and `SYMPTOM` parameter can take any characters except `comma`. Both `DISEASE` and `SYMPTOM` parameters cannot exceed
 `20` characters in length.

When you try to add an existing disease into the patient book, the following error message will be shown to you:

.Error Message for Duplicate Diseases
image::ErrorMessageForAddingExistingDisease.png[width="600"]

Hence, you may try command `find disease NAME` to find related symptoms of this existing disease.

Example:

* `add disease d/acne s/pustules s/blackheads`

.Message for Adding Disease Successfully
