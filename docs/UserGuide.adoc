The Car Park Finder is an application to find HDB (Housing Development Board) car parks in Singapore. It allows you to
work with a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* to display a list of car parks with the convenience of simply typing. If you
 *use the computer frequently* and *commute by driving*, you would find our application useful in helping you obtain
 various information about car parks.
