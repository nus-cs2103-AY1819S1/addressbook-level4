== Introduction

EventOrganiser is an application for managing and organising events built for NUS students, also known as Event Organiser.
More importantly, EventOrganiser is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, EventOrganiser can help you to arrange events faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `eventorganiser.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your EventOrganiser.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`listUser`* : lists all users in the Event Organiser
* **`addUser`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : creates new user named `John Doe` to the Event Organiser.
* **`addEvent`**`n/CS2103 Project Meeting a/SoC Canteen t/Urgent` : adds an event named CS2103 Project Meeting to be held at SoC Canteen.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

// tag::InBrief[]
== How it works, in brief

* To use the application, you must first create an account using the `addUser` command, and then `login`.
* If you are not yet logged in, you can still view event details using `selectEvent`, and find events using `findEvent` and `findEventByTime`, and list events using `listEvent`.
* Without logging in, you can also use the `selectUser`, `findUser` and `listUser` commands.
* When you are done, simply `logout` or `exit` the application.

=== Organise an event
* If you are looking to organise an event, you may do so using the `addEvent` command.
* After creating the event, you may wish to specify the date, time, or specify only after participants have joined.
* You may create polls to get participants to vote on the details of the event using `addPoll` and `addPollOption`.
* You can create a special TimePoll using `addTimePoll` after all participants have joined to decide on a suitable time. This generates poll options based on the NUS timetables/schedules of the participants.
* You may decide to `deleteEvent` after the event is over, or leave it in the organiser as a form of record.

=== Join an event
* If you are looking to join an event as a participant, you may search for an event to join using the `findEvent` and `findEventByTime` commands.
* You can also search for other users using the `findUser` and `listFriends` commands to see what events they have joined and join that event as well.
* After joining the event using `joinEvent`, you can vote in the polls by displaying the poll details using `displayPoll`.
* You can then add options using `addOption`, or simply vote for an option using `vote`.

=== Manage your account
* After setting up your account, you can edit your own details using the `editUser` command, and delete your own account using `deleteUser`.
* You can also search for other users using `suggestFriendsByInterests` and add them as your friend using `addFriend`, or remove them as a friend using `deleteFriend`.
* You can populate your schedule using an NUSMODs link, and also manually add time slots into your schedule.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Dates are all specified in `dd-MM-yyyy` format (e.g. `01-01-2019`, and Times are all specified in 24-hr `HH:mm` format (e.g. `13:30` is 1pm).
