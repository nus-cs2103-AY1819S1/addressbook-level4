== Introduction
**WishBook** (WB) is a piggy bank in a digital app form, made for people who need a user-friendly solution for keeping
 track of their disposable income. Not only does WB keep records of your savings, it also allows you to set items
  as goals for users to work towards, serving as a way to cultivate the habit of saving. WB is made for people who have
   material wants in life, but are uncertain of purchasing said wants, by helping them to reserve disposable income so
    that they know they can spend on their wants. So what are you waiting for? Go to Section 2, <<Quick Start>> and
     start saving!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `wishbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your WishBook app.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : Lists all the items you have set as wishes (sorted by due date).
* **`add`**`n/uPhoneXX p/1000 a/5m` : adds an item “uPhoneXX” as a goal to be completed in 5 months.
* *`help`*: displays list of command with usage.
* *`clear`*: clears view
* *`exit`* : exits the app


.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add WISH`, `WISH` is a parameter which
can be used as add iPhone.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g. in `list [FILTER]`, `FILTER` is an optional parameter, since the list
command can be used as `list` to display all wishes in WishBook.
** An exception to this is `TIME_GIVEN` and `END_DATE`, whereby only one of the two can be used in any command.
** The `add` command requires either `TIME_GIVEN` and `END_DATE`.
** The `edit` command can take either or none of them.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/broke`, `t/needs` etc.
* The `/` symbol between parameters means that you can use either of the parameters types in the command e.g. in
`add WISH PRICE [TIME_GIVEN]/[START_DATE to END_DATE]`, you provide either the `TIME_GIVEN` parameter or `START_DATE`
and `END_DATE` parameters.

====

=== Viewing help : `help`
Displays a popup window showing all the commands a user can use in `WishBook`. +
Format: `help`

=== Add a new wish: `add`
Add a new wish to the wish list. +
Format: `add n/WISH_NAME p/PRICE [a/PERIOD_GIVEN]/[d/END_DATE] [u/URL] [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
* `[END_DATE]`: Specified in _dd/mm/yyyy_ format.
* `[TIME_GIVEN]`: Specified in terms of years, months, weeks, and days, suffixes (coming after the value)
marking such time periods are _‘y’_, _‘m’_, _‘w’_, and _‘d’_ respectively.

The order of `[TIME_GIVEN]` must be from the biggest unit of time to the smallest unit of time, meaning that the
suffix _`y`_ cannot come after any of the other three suffixes, and _'w'_ cannot come after _'d'_, but can come
after _'y'_ and _'m'_.
