== Introduction

More importantly, LostBUTFound is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Fast typists will find that LostBUTFound can manage lost and found articles faster than traditional GUI applications.
