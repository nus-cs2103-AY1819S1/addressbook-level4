== Introduction
Welcome to the *Anakin* User Guide!

*Anakin*  was built for those who *want to make heavy use of flashcards without the hassle of managing physical copies*. More importantly, Anakin is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Anakin started from our desire to help users organize their flashcards better, and to reduce the paper waste generated by flashcards. As students ourselves, we believe that studying should be effective and easy to plan. Thus, we have built
in a scheduling system into Anakin which will help you plan out when to review your flashcards for optimal studying performance. Our scheduler uses spaced repetition which is the result of years
of https://www.supermemo.com/help/smalg.htm[psychology research]. Spaced repetiton embodies the idea that last minute studying has little effect. Instead, study sessions should be spread out to allow a student to best absorb infromation.

With this studying tool, we hope to not just decrease paper wastage but also to create a fun environment which can help students sustain their motivation to study
throughout the semester.

To get started, head over to <<Quick Start>>!

For a quick review of commands, check out <<Command Summary>>.
== How to Use This Guide
This document is designed for users with varying levels of proficiency. Most command in the guide can be read standalone, but there are
occasional references to other related commands.

To assist you, we have added sample use cases of each command in the document

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `newdeck n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `newdeck n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `newdeck [n/NAME]` can be used as `newdeck n/My Deck` or as `newdeck`.
* Optional items separated by - e.g. `editdeck 1 [q/Question?]-[a/Answer]` denote that at least one of the optional
 parameters are needed minimally to execute the command.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`, `a/ANSWER q/QUESTION` is also acceptable.
* Any argument followed by `...` indicates that the command is able to accept multiple arguments for that field.
* If you provide multiple parameters for fields that do not support multiple arguments, only the last argument will be accepted. I.e. If you entered `newdeck n/nameOne n/nameTwo`, the new deck will have the name "nameTwo".

 in the desired difficulty as a keyword after the command.

For example:

`list hard` will display all cards with the `hard` difficulty

Multiple difficulties can be specified as well, in which case all cards with a difficulty matching one of those
specified will be displayed:

`list easy hard` will display all cards with either an `easy` or `hard` difficulty.

****

Example:

* 1. First, display all the decks in Anakin using `list`. +

image::exportScreenshot1.png[width="500"]

====

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the state of Anakin.
(`newdeck`, `editdeck`, `deldeck`, `newcard`, `editcard`, `delcard`,
`sort`, `classify`, `cd`, `cd ..`).
====

Examples:

* `deldeck 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `deldeck 1` command) +

* `history` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `deldeck 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `deldeck 1` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delcard 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delcard 1` command) +

Format: `clear`


=== Exiting Anakin : `exit`
To exit the program. +
Format: `exit`

// tag::autocompletion[]
=== Autocompletion : Hit `<TAB>`

Hit <TAB> for autocompletion so you don't have to remember verbose commands. If there is an autocompletion available, hitting <TAB> will replace the current text in the command box with the autocompletion text.

Examples: +

1. Suppose you are attempting to create a new card.

image::newCardPreAutocomplete.png[width="500"]

Image: Partially completed `newcard` command.

2. Just hit <TAB> and you will instantly get the desired result

image::newCardPostAutocomplete.png[width="500"]

Image: After pressing <TAB> the command is automatically completed!

[NOTE]
====
If the command box is empty, autocompletion will default to ``cd 1``.
====
[WARNING]
====
This feature does not work when trailing or preceding whitespace is included in the command.
====
// end::autocompletion[]

// tag::rank[]
=== Rank : `rank`

Use this command to sort all cards by a user's cumulative performance score on each card. +
Format: `rank` +
Examples: Suppose you are studying for an important exam, and you want to find out which cards you performed poorly on so you can review them.


1. Classify cards as described in the `classify` section above and then type `rank`

image::rankScreenshot1.png[width="500"]

Image: Appearance of cards before sorting by performance

2. Type `rank` and you will instantly get the desired result

image::rankScreenshot2.png[width="500"]
Image: Appearance of cards after sorting by performance. As can be seen, harder cards move to the top. +

[NOTE]
====
 The indicator in the card panel only shows the most recent classification of the card while the scheduling algorithm takes into account all past reviews.
As such, cards labelled HARD may not always be above cards ranked NORMAL.
====


// end::rank[]


== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Export all your decks, copy the .xml files to the other Computer, then use the import command to import your decks.

*Q*: Why is it called *Anakin*? +
*A*: Because using CLI is as cool and mysterious as using the Force.
