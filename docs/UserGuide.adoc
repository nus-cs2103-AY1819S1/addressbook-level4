== Introduction

3VIA is for learners who wants to *reinforce their knowledge*. More importantly, 3VIA is *optimized for those
who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, 3VIA will better boost your memory compared to traditional GUI Trivia apps. Interested?
Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `3VIA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your 3VIA.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all cards according to their tags
* **`add`**`add q/What is the formula for force? a/force = mass * acceleration a/Physics` : adds a card with question
`What is the formula for force?` to the the trivia application.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd card in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add q/QUESTION`, `QUESTION` is a parameter
which can be used as `add q/What is the formula for force?`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `q/QUESTION [t/TAG]` can be used as `q/why? t/Physics` or as `q/why?`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}`
(i.e. 0 times), `t/Physics`, `t/Physics t/MustKnow` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `q/QUESTION p/ANSWER`, `p/ANSWER n/QUESTION` is also acceptable.
