== Introduction

WatchOver is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing tasks*. More importantly, WatchOver is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, WatchOver enables you to manage your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `watchover.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your task manager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tasks
* **`add`**`n/Do CS2103 tutorial t/02-12-18 1330 p/5 d/Do it for Jelena l/tutorial` : adds a task named `Do 2103 tutorial` to the task manager.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Count eggs`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [l/LABEL]` can be used as `n/Count eggs l/tutorial` or as `n/Count eggs`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[l/LABEL]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `l/tutorial`, `l/tutorial l/skipped` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PRIORITY_VALUE`, `p/PRIORITY_VALUE n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* `+Example` indicates positive example while `-Example` indicates negative example.

Date Format: `yyyy-mm-dd` or `yyyy-mm-dd hhmm`. A missing `hhmm` field will cause time to
be interpreted as the start of the day, i.e `00:00`.

On task creation, the task's `INDEX` is shown as such:
```
Task <INDEX>, <TASK_NAME> was created.
```
[%hardbreaks]
+Example:
