== Introduction

Module Planner is for National University of Singapore (NUS) Computer Science and Computer Engineering undergraduate students who *prefer to use a desktop app* to keep track of past modules and list possible future modules based on the academic requirements. More importantly, Module Planner is optimized for those who prefer to work with a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Module Planner can get your module planning tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest `moduleplanner.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Module Planner.
. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
. The first page you will see when Module Planner starts up.
+
.On start up

+
.. Input Box: input commands here.
.. Result Display: displays command results and other associated messages.
.. Time Period: displays the year and semester you are currently viewing.
.. Taken Modules Panel: lists modules that you put into the specified time period.
.. Suggested Modules Panel: lists modules that suggested to you for that time period.
.. Multipurpose Panel: displays results for the `Find` and `Status` commands.

// end::labelledUi[]

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* **`setup`**`m/Computer Science` : set your major to be Computer Science in Module Planner to get tailored module suggestion for Computer Science student.
* **`suggest`**`y/1 s/1` : suggest modules you can take in first year, semester 1.
* **`add`**`y/1 s/1 c/CS1231 c/MA1521` : adds modules CS1231 and MA1521 to the year 1 semester 1 modules list.
* **`delete`**`c/CS1231` : deletes module CS1231 from the Module Planner.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters that you can supply, e.g. in `suggest y/YEAR s/SEMESTER`, `YEAR` and `SEMESTER` are parameters which can be used as `suggest y/1 s/1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `setup ... [f/FOCUS_AREA]` can be used as `setup ... f/software engineering` or as `setup ...`.
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `MODULE_CODE...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `CS1231`, `CS1231 MA1521` etc.

|=======================================================================
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Open this user guide in a new window.

Format: `help`

// tag::setup[]

=== Setting user profile : `setup`

Initialises your profile with your major and optionally your focus areas so that Module Planner can
give you module suggestions that are more relevant to you. +
Format: `setup m/MAJOR [f/FOCUS_AREA]...`

****
* The major and focus areas should be spelt out in full.
* The major and focus areas are case insensitive. e.g. `Computer Science` is the same as `cOmpUter scienCe`.
* This feature currently only supports majors and focus areas listed below. Support for other majors and focus areas will come beyond v2.0.
** Major:
*** Computer Science
*** Computer Engineering
** Focus area:
*** Algorithms and Theory
*** Artificial Intelligence
*** Software Engineering
* Default user profile is set to `Computer Science` major with no focus area.
****

Examples:

* `setup m/Computer Engineering`
* `setup m/Computer Science f/Software Engineering`

// end::setup[]

// tag::add[]

=== Adding modules: `add`

Adds the specified modules to the list of modules that you have taken or want to take for the specified year and semester. +
Format: `add y/YEAR s/SEMESTER c/MODULE_CODE...`

Examples:

* `add y/1 s/1 c/MA1101R`
* `add y/1 s/1 c/CS1231 c/CS1101S`

An observable change can be seen in the Taken Modules Panel after successfully adding a module, like shown below:

Before:

image::AddBefore.png[width="300"]

After:

image::AddAfter.png[width="300"]

[NOTE]
From the input list of modules, a subset of it which will be added to the planner are modules that does not fall under any of the following criterias: +
1. Modules not offered by NUS +
2. Modules not in the planner +
3. Modules which one of its preclusions exist in the planner +
4. Two or more modules equivalent (preclusions) to each other +
5. Modules which prerequisites are not fulfilled in the previous semesters

// end::add[]

// tag::delete[]

=== Deleting modules : `delete`

Deletes the specified modules from list of current or future modules for the specified year and semester. +
Format: `delete c/MODULE_CODE...`

Examples:

* `delete c/CS1010`
* `delete c/CS1231 c/MA1521`

Consider a module planner stocked with the modules CS1010 and CS1231 in year 1 semester 1, and the modules CS2030
and CS2040 in year 1 semester 2. If `delete c/CS1010` is executed, CS1010 is removed, as well as the modules CS2030
and CS2040 in year 1 semester 2 since they have CS1010 as a prerequisite.

You can see the change in the Taken Modules Panel in the before and after images.

// end::delete[]

// tag::find[]
=== Finding information on a module : `find`

Retrieves the information of the specified module. +
Format: `find c/MODULE_CODE`

Example:

* `find c/CS1010`

You should see the module information for CS1010 in the Multipurpose Panel.

image::find.png[width="790"]

// end::find[]

// tag::goto[]

=== Going to a different year and semester : `goto`

Changes the view to the specified year and semester. +
Format: `goto y/YEAR s/SEMESTER`

Example:

* `goto y/1 s/1`

The change can be seen in Taken Modules Panel in the before and after images.

// tag::list[]
=== Listing modules : `list`

If a valid year is supplied, shows a list of all modules that you have added to that year. If no year is supplied, shows a list of all modules that you have added to every year. +
Format: `list [y/YEAR]`

[TIP]
====
* The list of modules will be automatically updated upon adding or deleting module(s).
====

[NOTE]
====
* If a valid year is supplied but no modules have been added to the specified year, will show an empty list.
* If no year is supplied and no modules have been added to any year, will show an empty list.
====

Examples:

* `list y/1` +
Lists all modules taken in year 1, both semester 1 and 2 (if they exist).

* `list` +
Lists all modules taken in every year, from year 1 semester 1 to year 4 semester 2 (if they exist).
// end::list[]

// tag::status[]

=== Getting status update : `status`

Shows how many core and general education module credits that you have taken and how many credits that you need to take. +
Format: `status`

You could see the status displayed on MultiPurpose Panel as shown below:

image::StatusIllustration.png[width="790"]
// end::status[]

// tag::suggest[]
=== Suggesting modules : `suggest`

If a valid year and semester are supplied, suggests a list of modules that you are available to take in the specified year and semester, based on modules that you have added. A module is available for you if:

* You have fulfilled (added to ModulePlanner) all the prerequisites of the module in the semester(s) prior to the one you specified.
* You have not fulfilled (added to ModulePlanner) any preclusions to the module in any semester (including semester(s) after the one you specified).
* You have not fulfilled (added to ModulePlanner) the module in any semester (including semester(s) after the one you specified).

The list of modules is sorted, with core modules being on top, followed by general education modules and unrestricted electives modules.

Format: `suggest y/YEAR s/SEMESTER`

[TIP]
====
* The list of suggested modules will be automatically updated upon adding or deleting module(s).
====

[NOTE]
====
* This feature currently only supports *Computer Science* major. If user profile is set to other major through <<Setting user profile : `setup`, `setup`>> command,
this feature will only give you generic module suggestion sorted in a lexicographical order.
* The list of suggested modules will not be automatically updated after changing major through `setup`. You have to re-execute `suggest` to update the list.
* Support for other majors will come in v2.0.
====

Examples:

* `suggest y/1 s/1`
* `suggest y/4 s/2`
// end::suggest[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores Module Planner to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the Module Planner's content (`add`, `delete`, and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete c/CS1010` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete c/CS1010` command) +

* `goto y/1 s/1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete c/CS1010` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete c/CS1010` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete c/CS1010` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete c/CS1010` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete c/CS1010` command) +

* `delete c/CS1010` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete c/CS1010` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete c/CS1010` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete c/CS1010` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Clearing all modules : `clear`

Clears all modules added into Module Planner and the module suggestion. +
Format: `clear`

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

Module Planner data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.
