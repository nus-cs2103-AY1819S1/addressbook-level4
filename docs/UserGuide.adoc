== Valid Inputs

=== Index

Index should always be an integer. It has a maximum range of 0 (exclusive) to 2,147,483,647 (inclusive).
Any index outside of this range will automatically make any command an invalid input.

=== Name

Name should only contain alphabetical characters and spaces, and should not be blank.

=== Phone

Phone numbers should only be 8 digits long and should not contain spaces.

=== Email

* Emails should be of the format `local-part@domain`
* The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (!#$%&'*+/=?`{|}~^.-) .
* This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name must:
     - be at least 2 characters long
     - start and end with alphanumeric characters
     - consist of alphanumeric characters, a period or a hyphen for the characters in between, if any.

=== Subjects

Valid subjects are limited to only the following subjects: +

`Mathematics`, `Biology`, `Chemistry`, `Physics`, `Economics`, `Geography`, `History`, `English`, `Art`, `Music`,
`Computing`, `Chinese`, `Malay`, `Tamil`, `French`, `German`, `Japanese`, `Literature`

* In order to be valid subjects, the input must be a full substring match of length 3 or more with any of the valid subjects. This is to avoid too short of keyword matching.
* The match must start at the beginning of the subject name. This is to avoid confusion and multiple matching.
* Input must be a single word. This is to avoid cases where both invalid and valid keyword are input by user.
* Matching is case insensitive.

Examples:

* `Biology`, `Bio`, or `bio` will match with `Biology`.
* `iology` will not match will `Biology` as the match does not start from the beginning.
* `Ma` will not match `Mathematics` because the length of subtring is shorter than three.
* `phy` will only match `Physics` and will not match `Geography` as matching is done from the beginning of the string.
* `Maths` will not match `Mathematics` as it is not a full substring match.
* `History Literature` will not match anything as it contains more than 1 word.

=== TuitionTiming

The days of the week are case sensitive and the valid inputs are: +

`Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`, `Sunday`

* The time should follow the 12-hour clock (e.g. 12:00pm)
