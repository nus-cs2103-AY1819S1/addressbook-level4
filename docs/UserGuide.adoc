== Introduction

*CLInic* is a desktop application that is created for clinics and optimised specifically for clinic receptionists and doctors who *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you have average to high typing speed and are in need of a clinic management application, CLInic can get your clinic management tasks more efficiently than traditional GUI apps.
You will have *all the tools* needed to manage your patient and medicine data, completed with an efficient queue management system. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Follow the steps below to get started with CLInic.

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `CLInic.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CLInic application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe ic/S1234567X p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a patient named `John Doe` to the CLInic database.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Command Format*

* Some commands have an alias, which you can also use to execute the command e.g. to add a person to the address book, you can type either `add n/John Doe` or `a n/John Doe`.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `[b/BLOOD_TYPE] [da/DRUG_ALLERGY]` can be used as `b/A+ da/Panadol` or as `b/A+`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[da/DRUG_ALLERGY]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `da/Panadol`, `da/Panadol da/Zyrtec` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* <INDEX> refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient or medicine list.
