== Introduction

3VIA is a great way for _learners_ to *reinforce and test out their knowledge*. Tired of using a mouse or trackpad to navigate? Don't worry, 3VIA is *optimised for a veteran Command Line Interface (CLI) user*, while still having the benefits of a beautiful Graphical User Interface (GUI).

3VIA will spur and energise your desire to be that A* student, without ever leaving the keyboard. We believe that it should only take 3 steps to get that Very Important A (3VIA, get it?).

You can read the user guide from start to finish by jumping right in to <<Quick Start>> to get started or just use it as a reference. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version _9_ or later installed in your computer.
.  Download the latest `3VIA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here] and copy the file into the folder you want to use as the home folder for your 3VIA app.
.  Double-click the icon to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds and you're ready to go!

[qanda]
UPPER_CASE _are parameters you should include in use the command_:: `add q/QUESTION` means `add q/Why is the earth round`.
Items in square brackets are optional:: `q/QUESTION [t/TOPIC]` means `q/Why is the earth round t/Physics`
Items with `...` after them can be used optionally or multiple times:: `[t/TOPIC] ...` can be `t/Physics t/Math t/Literature`
Parameters written can be in any order:: `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER` can be `a/ANSWER q/QUESTION`

[WARNING]
`[t/TOPIC]` is case sensitive
====
*Notes*

* 3VIA does not allow duplicated questions.
* Questions are compared without regards to their case sensitivity. Hence question of "why is..." is same as "Why is...".
* When adding questions and answers, 3VIA will automatically trim the whitespaces that are found in preceding and endings of the text.
====

Examples:

* `add q/What is the formula for force? a/force = mass * acceleration t/Physics`
* `add q/What is the capital of Singapore? a/Singapore t/GeneralKnowledge t/Geography`

// tag::learn[]
=== Start learning: `learn`

Will direct you to the learn page with the cards you want to learn. If you want to learn from everything that is

Start an open-ended test of a specified topic. In an open-ended test, the user will key in their answer to the questions, and get the choose whether he/she has answered correctly by comparing their answers with the expected answer. +
Format: `testO TOPIC`

****
* The test aims to test the knowledge of the user with the existing questions of a specified topic that are in the trivia application.
****

The following commands can only be used during an `Open Ended Test`.

==== Answering a question:

Type your answer in the command field and press `enter` to submit your answer. If you don't have an answer in mind, you can just press `enter` with nothing in the command field. We accept your silence as an answer. +
Format: `ANSWER_FROM_USER`

==== Determining the correctness of your answer:

After answering the question, you would be given a comparison between the expected and actual answer you entered. You would be required to determine the correctness of your answer since the questions are open ended. The app will keep track of your score. +
Note: Any input that begins with 'Y' or 'N' will be acceptable inputs. +
Format: `Y` (correct) OR `N` (wrong)

==== Quit the test:

Test is exited. +
Format: `exit`
//end::openendedtest[]

// tag::matchtest1[]
=== Start a MatchTest: `testM`

Start a test of matching questions and answers for a specified topic. In a `MatchTest`, all the questions and answers in
that topic will be displayed. You will then have to match all the questions to their respective answer. +
Format: `testM TOPIC`

[NOTE]
The navigation tabs will be disabled during the `MatchTest`. If you want to navigate to other pages, you would need to exit
the `MatchTest` by entering the `exit` command, as described in the section on https://cs2103-ay1819s1-w12-3.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#quit-matchtest[Quit MatchTest].

The following commands can only be used during a `MatchTest`.

==== Match question and answer:

Will match a pair of question and answer during a `MatchTest`. +
Format: `INDEX_OF_QUESTION INDEX_OF_ANSWER`

An example is given in the below screenshot, where the command of `2 3` will select the question and answer that is boxed
in green.

image::UserGuideMatchCommand.png[width="790"]

Another way to match a pair of question and answer is to solely enter the index of the answer. By doing so, we will
assume that you would be matching first question to the answer that is specified. +
Format: `INDEX_OF_ANSWER`

An example of such a usage can be seen in the the below screenshot.

image::UserGuideMatchCommandWithoutQuestion.png[width="790"]
// end::matchtest1[]
[NOTE]
If you have 2 questions with the same answer, then there will be 2 possibilities in matching 1 of the questions.
Also note that answers are case sensitive. Hence the answer of "f = m * a" is not equal to "F = m * A".
// tag::matchtest2[]

==== Quit MatchTest:

If you want to stop an ongoing `MatchTest`, you can enter the `exit` command at any time during the test. The command
will bring you to the test menu page.

After the `MatchTest` has ended, a result page will be shown. After reviewing your results, you can exit from the `MatchTest` by
entering the `exit` command. The command will bring you to the test menu page. +
Format: `exit`

[NOTE]
Only those attempts from a completed `MatchTest` will be saved into your hard disk.
// end::matchtest2[]

// tag::stats[]
=== View statistics for a certain test or overall learning path: `review` `[coming in v2.0]`

Results of previous tests, questions, expected answers and the user’s answers for that particular topic will be displayed. +
A summary of testing results will be displayed in review page.

Format: `review TOPIC` _or_ `review` _or_
`review HL`

Example:

`review Physics` +
_Displays the overall statistics of questions attempted of Physics_.

`review` +
_Displays the overall statistics of all questions attempted_.

`review HL` +
_Displays card list sorted by high to low times of mistakes_
// end::stats[]

// tag::import[]
=== Cram More Knowledge!: `import`
Quickly import multiple flash cards from existing notes or documents into 3VIA.

Format: `import FILEPATH`

Example:
****
* `import C:\Users\username\Desktop\file.txt` +
_Imports the contents from the file.txt text file from the specified file location on Windows._
* `import file.txt` +
_Imports the contents from the file.txt text file relative to the location of the 3VIA application._
****

TIP: The file path refers to either the *absolute file path* or the *relative file path* of the import file.

==== Creating your import file:

Open your existing notes or create a new one. You may use any text editing programs such as Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc.
Below are 2 rules regarding the import file type and format that must be adhered too.

. Import file type:
* The file must be in *UTF-8 format*.
* The file must be a *plain text file* (i.e. file.txt).

[start = 2]
. Import file format:

image::import_file_format.png[import file format pic]
[options = "header", cols = "1,2", caption=""]
.Formating explaination
|===
|Keys| Purpose
|kbd:[SPACE] + kbd:[t] + kbd:[/]| A space and "t/" prefix separates each topic
|kbd:[TAB]| A tab space separates a question and an answer
|kbd:[&#9166;]| A new line separates each card
|===

[WARNING]
Duplicate questions in the import text file will result in an import failure.
Duplicated answers with different questions are allowed.

==== Importing your file:

Now that your file is ready, head over to 3VIA and lets begin the import.

. Enter the `import` command followed by the absolute/ relative file path of the import file you previously created in the command
box as seen below.
+
image::import_step1.png[import step 1 pic, 500]

[start = 2]
. Hit enter/ return to confirm. 3VIA will now display a list of cards that has been imported.
+
image::import_step2.png[import step 2 pic, 500]

TIP: You can `edit` or `delete` any of the recently imported cards and/or even `undo` the import if you are not satisfied
with the cards imported.
// end::import[]

// tag::exit[]
=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

[IMPORTANT]
If the `exit` Command is used during in any of the testing mode, it will bring you to the test menu page instead of
exiting from the programme. If you want to exit from the program, execute the `exit` command again.
// end::exit[]

=== Saving data
3VIA saves data in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous 3VIA application folder.
