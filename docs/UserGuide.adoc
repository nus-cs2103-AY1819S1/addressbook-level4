== Introduction

The Expense Tracker application is a desktop application which enables users to track their expenses.
The application features both a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which provides users
with the efficiency of the CLI while still having the benefits of a GUI.

== Quick Start

Follow these steps to start using the Expense Tracker:

.  Install Java (version 9 or later) on your computer by going https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html[here]
and downloading the Java SE Runtime Environment for your operating system.
.  Download the latest `expensetracker.jar` file from https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-T12-1/main/releases[here]
.  Copy the file to the folder which you want to use as the home folder for your Expense Tracker.
.  Double-click the `expensetracker.jar` file to start the app. The GUI will appear and look like this:

+
.  Type the command `signup USERNAME` in the command box (the box where it says "Enter command here...") and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it, where USERNAME is the username of your choice. E.g. `signup username123`
.  Type the command `login u/USERNAME` in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it, where USERNAME is the username you signed up with in the previous step. e.g. `login u/username123` +
You are now able to use all the commands of the app. +
.  Type commands in the command box, as highlighted in the figure below, and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of all available commands.

== User Interface

.User interface

There are six main components to the user interface, each highlighted by the coloured box as per the diagram above.

=== Expense List / Statistics Panel

This is the portion highlighted in the red box.

==== Expense List
The Expense List shows the list of expenses. By default, the list will show all expenses in the Expense Tracker.
When commands such as `find` and `list` are used, they change which expenses will be shown in the Expense List.

[NOTE]
====
Each expense has an index number next to the expense name. These are relevant to the `delete` and `edit` commands.
====

==== Statistics Panel
When the `stats` command is used, the Expense List changes to the Statistics Panel, where statistics about expenses
will be displayed.

=== Budget Tracker

This is the portion highlighted in the blue box.

This is a feature which is work in progress.

=== Notifications Panel

This is the portion highlighted in the green box.

This is a feature which is work in progress.

=== Command Box and Console

This is the portion highlighted in the yellow box.

The Command Box is where the "Enter command here..." is located. To enter a command in the Command Box, user your mouse
and click anywhere within the box, then proceed to type a command. +

The Console is where any success and error messages, relevant to the most recent command entered, will appear .

=== Menu Bar

This is the portion highlighted in the orange box.

The menu bar contains two submenus, which allow the user to either exit the application or to open the help window.
These have the same effect as using the commands `exit` and `help` respectively.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* All commands begin with the command word. The command word may be followed by parameters.
* According to the format of each command, words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters which can be specified by the user
** E.g. the `login` command has the format of `login u/USERNAME` where `USERNAME` is a parameter which can be replaced by a user specified value. In order to log in to an account with the username "username123", the user will enter the command `login u/username123`.
* Parameters in square brackets are optional
** E.g if a command has a parameter format of `n/EXPENSE_NAME [t/TAG]`, the parameters can be used as `n/Birthday Present t/Girlfriend`, which includes the "Girlfriend" tag, or as `n/Birthday Present`, which does not include a tag.
* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times
** E.g. if a command format contains the parameter `[t/TAG]...`, the parameter can be replaced with `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command format specifies `n/NAME c/CATEGORY`, using the parameters `c/CATEGORY n/NAME` is also acceptable.

== FAQ

*Q*: Do I need to manually save my data? +
*A*: There is no need to save your manually. All the data in Expense Tracker is automatically saved in the hard disk
after
any
command that changes the data. +


*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*:  Install the app in the other computer and copy the `data` folder in your previous Expense Tracker folder over to the new Expense Tracker folder on your other Computer.
If you wish to copy only one user over, create a folder named `data` in the app directory on the other computer and copy the xml file with your username in the `data` folder of the old computer into the `data` folder of the new computer.
//tag::dataencryption[]
*Q*: How is my expense data kept safe when I use this application? +
*A*: All user expense-specific data is encrypted. The program ensures that no one will be able to decrypt encrypted information without your actual plain text password, which is not stored anywhere. So rest assured that no one can access your data without your password.

*Q*: How do I manually encrypt text to edit my user XML file as a technologically-savvy user? +
*A*: You can carry out the following steps to do so:

. Open http://murmurhash.shorelabs.com/[this website] and wait for it to load.
. Under `MurmurHash3 (32/128 bit, x86/x64)`, enter your password in the text box labelled `An ASCII Text`.
. Under the text box from step 2, there is a dropdown menu that has `x86` selected. Click on it and select `x64`.
. Beside the menu from step 3, there is a dropdown menu that has `32-bit` selected. Click on it and select `128-bit`.
. Note down the string of characters on the bottom left of the text box from step 2. This is your `encryption key`.
. Open https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption[this website] and wait for it to load.
. Use the left column on the web page and enter the text you wish to encrypt.
. Use the `encryption` key from step 5 as the `secret key` and leave the other options as default.
. Click on the `Encrypt` button to get the encrypted text you want.
