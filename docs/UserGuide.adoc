== Introduction
OASIS is an employee management application that brings your office together. It is an all-in-one tool for office administration and communication that runs on any computer. With the use of primarily textual commands coupled with a beautiful user interface, you can get your administrative jobs done faster than with traditional point-and-click applications. Some of the main features that you can look forward to using are employee records management, authentication and permissions, assignment management, and leave management. Sounds good? Jump to Section 2, <<Quick Start, Quickstart>> to get started. Enjoy!

=== An Introduction to OASIS
The image shown below highlights the different sections of OASIS's user interface:

*Command Auto Complete*

OASIS has provided you with a command auto complete feature to aid you with the usage of commands. With this functionality, you no longer have to memorise any commands!

When you type commands into the command box, a drop down list of possible commands will appear, as shown in the screenshot below.

image::autoCompleteDropDownList.png[width=300]

When the drop down list is shown, you can do the following:

After selecting the command, you will see that the command will be displayed in the command box.
