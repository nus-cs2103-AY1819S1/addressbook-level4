== Introduction

3VIA is a great way for _learners_ to *reinforce and test out their knowledge*. Tired of using a mouse or trackpad to navigate? Don't worry, 3VIA is *optimised for a veteran Command Line Interface (CLI) user*, while still having the benefits of a beautiful Graphical User Interface (GUI).

3VIA will spur and energise your desire to be that A* student, without ever leaving the keyboard. We believe that it should only take 3 steps to get that Very Important A (3VIA, get it?).

You can read the user guide from start to finish by jumping right in to <<Quick Start>> to get started or just use it as a reference. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version _9_ or later installed in your computer.
.  Download the latest `3VIA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here] and copy the file into the folder you want to use as the home folder for your 3VIA app.
.  Double-click the icon to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds and you're ready to go!
