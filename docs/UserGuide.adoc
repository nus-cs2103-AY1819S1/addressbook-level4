== Introduction

TheTracker is for NUS students who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts, events or modules*. More importantly, TheTracker is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TheTracker can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps whilst being able to keep track with your friends! Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `listmodules` : lists all modules
* `addperson n/John Doe t/98765432 t/johnd@example.com t/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* `deleteoccasion 2` : deletes the 2nd entry in your occasion list
