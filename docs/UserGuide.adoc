== Introduction

*Anakin*  is for those who *want to make heavy use of flashcards without the hassle of managing physical copies*. More importantly, Anakin is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
