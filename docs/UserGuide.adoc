== Introduction

Cow is an application for those who prefer to use a desktop app for
managing tasks and contacts. It is optimized for those who prefer to
work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Cow can
get your contact and task management done faster than traditional GUI
apps.

== Quick Start

1.  Ensure you have JRE 9 or later installed.
2.  Download the `.jar`.
3.  Place it in the folder where you want the data files to be stored.
4.  Type in a command and press `Enter` to execute it. For a start, type
`help` and press `Enter` to see the help text.

== Features

**Command Format**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as
`add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used
as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero
times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as
`\` (i.e. 0 times),`t/friend`,`t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies
`n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
