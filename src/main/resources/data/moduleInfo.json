In Channel Management, not much attention is usually paid to understanding marketing channels in detail. In fact people used to call channels the `dark continent? of marketing, that is best left to `truckers?. But, is this true? One can make at least four observations: long term commitment of channel related decisions, existence of channel `power play,? market dynamics caused by channel changes, and the impact of internet on channel intermediaries. All these issues are very difficult to comprehend and solve if we do not understand `what channels are for?? Channel management is not just managing the retailers and the trucks and delivery personnel, but it is much larger than that. In Pricing, the one element of marketing strategy that is least understood and hence constantly feared by many managers is pricing. This is because pricing is a very complex issue. On one hand, it is supposed to reflect all the strategic steps the company has taken to bring the product to the consumer and convince him/her to buy it as well. On the other hand, it is supposed to reflect what the consumer would get out of the product by paying that price to acquire it. Will there be a match between the two? Perhaps and perhaps not. This dilemma makes it imperative for a manager needs to understand and analyze various factors in arriving at an appropriate pricing strategy. And, pricing does not operate in vacuum. It has to be married with other elements of the marketing strategy, including the channel management we discuss in this course. Thus, understanding the broader picture of the various elements of pricing, and building a scientific framework on pricing will always be reliable and better in the long run.","preclusions":[],"prerequisites":[]},{"code":"BMA5524","name":"Marketing Analytics","creditCount":4.0,"description":"","preclusions":[],"prerequisites":[]},{"code":"BMA5528","name":"Business To Business Marketing","creditCount":4.0,"description":"","preclusions":[],"prerequisites":[]},{"code":"BMA5530","name":"Design Thinking & Product Innovations","creditCount":4.0,"description":"This module focuses on integrating Design Thinking into the creative development of innovative products and services.

A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5.

Structures and electronic and magnetic structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced to the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre = 10-9 metre). They exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size. The nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and engineering. To understand the nanoworld, we will introduce basic and advance spectroscopy and scattering synchrotron-based techniques such as x-ray absorption, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, resonant soft x-ray scattering, xray photoemission spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. We will also introduce scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and techniques relevant to the nanometre scale.

Almost all religions decree the magic power of pure water. To our experience, where there is water, there is life. Water is widely regarded as the \u201cmatrix of life\u201d. Nevertheless, various scientific debates are associated with water. For example, unbelievably, in the 1980s French scientist Benveniste and his collaborators proposed the notion of the \u201cmemory of water\u201d. On the other hand, proteins are the most important functional players for all forms of life. An increasing spectrum of human diseases more than neurodegenerative diseases is characterized by aggregation of specific proteins, while aggregation of non-specific proteins are associated with aging even down to Escherichia coli. In 2005, we discovered that these \u201caggregated/insoluble\u201d proteins could marvellously be solubilized in pure water, which thus offers my group to tackle an emerging but challenging problem in biology: molecular mechanisms for neurodegenerative diseases and aging. In this module, we will explore how water shaped the emergence and evolution of life and how proteins get aggregated and subsequently gain toxicity to trigger diseases and aging.

In today's information-oriented environment, a marketing manager cannot succeed without a thorough understanding of the research process. By understanding the research process, he can better judge the suitability, reliability and the validity of a research study in his decision-makings. Students will learn by doing in this course. While we will use class time to discuss appropriate research topics, students are required to do lots of activities by themselves in order to facilitate their learning by doing. In doing so, this course incorporates an experimental element in marketing research and consulting. As a marketing information provider, students will be assisting a firm by collecting and interpreting market data as a means toward the development of a superior marketing plan. At the same time, students will conduct tutorial activities that will provide opportunities for students to practice the key topics covered in the class. This course is intended to acquaint students with the fundamental marketing research process. More specifically, this course aims: (i) To familiarise the student with the fundamental marketing research skills of problem formulation, research design, questionnaire design, data collection, data analysis, and report presentation and writing. (ii) To have the student gain perspective and practice in applying these skills through a research project. (iii) To develop an understanding of decision making in marketing, its inherent difficulties and pitfalls and the importance of information in marketing research.","preclusions":[],"prerequisites":["MKT1003"]},{"code":"MKT2414","name":"Marketing Venture Challenge","creditCount":4.0,"description":"Every day new products are created that help fuel new ideas and innovation.

Principally ideas of Descartes and Leibniz with emphasis on Kant\u2019s concept of space and time. The mathematization of science in the 17th Century - from Descartes use of coordinate geometry to Galileo\u2019s Principle of Inertia and the mathematics of motion will serve to showcase how the early concepts took shape. - The mathematical strand will serve to showcase how Euclid\u2019s axiomatic approach to geometry formed the basis of subsequent generalizations that led to the characterization of space and time. Here students will be introduced to structures such as topological spaces, manifolds and Riemannian spaces that form the basis of the space-time fabric. - The physical strand will touch on the notion of physical symmetries and its relation to geometry. In particular, Galilean and Special relativity will serve to elucidate how the motion of particles in the space-time fabric reveals its geometrical structure. This will culminate in Einstein\u2019s Equivalence Principle and its implications leading up to the General theory of Relativity. The aim here is to provide a coherent exposition of how the three disciplines come together in providing insights into the nature of space, time and matter. The questions raised will force students to examine and reflect on the extent to which our commonsensical views of the physical space accurately describes the way nature really is; and to what degree this view is tenable on the basis of detailed quantitative reasons and empirical evidence.
