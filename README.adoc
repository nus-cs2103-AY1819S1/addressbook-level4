* This is a desktop menu application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line
Interface) which is oriented for typist user.
* The target user group is F&B owners who operate one or more restaurants in NUS. This application aims to improve
the effectiveness and efficiency of managing their restaurants. Essentially, *MeNUS* is the one and only restaurant
management system they will ever need.
