Housing & Development Board (HDB) car parks in Singapore. It has a GUI (Graphic User Interface) that allows users to
view vital information such as parking lots availability for each car park.

efficient manner.

* Main features of _Car Park Finder_:
** Find by location helps to narrows down the car parks near your destination
** Filter through the list of car parks with the use of flags to get the preferred choice of car park
** Receive notifications on how many parking lots are still available for a car park
** Use of autocomplete to simplify overcomplicated commands by prompting correct format
