'Ren' in Mandarin translates to 'person' or 'people', and true to our name, this app is all about managing one's
network of clients in an organized, efficient and intuitive manner. InsuRen is geared to the needs of the modern
Insurance salesman, but anyone whose business is their strong rapport with their clients will find this
to be an indispensable tool.

Managing one's clientele has never been easier! InsuRen is designed to be used
without the hassle of a mouse, as users interact with their database purely through intuitive text commands.
Some key features of our product include:

* Adding tags to contacts and sorting contacts by tags.
* Scheduling meetings for each contact and consolidating all meetings into a weekly timetable.
* Keeping track of clients' payment dues.
* Importing contacts from external databases and exporting the contacts in InsuRen's database.
* And many more!
