Welcome to *LostBUTFound*! *LostBUTFound* is a management tool designed to help *administrators manage lost and found articles*.

Managing lost and found articles can be a frustrating experience, especially when there are a huge amount of articles to keep track of. LostBUTFound streamlines this management process and help you to increase your productivity.

More importantly, LostBUTFound is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Fast typists will find that LostBUTFound can manage lost and found articles faster than traditional GUI applications.
