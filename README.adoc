* This is a desktop Health Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* The Health Book application targets clinic receptionists who need to manage a significant number of appointments
* The Health Book application is most effective when user has preference for CLI and is able to type fast rather than mouse input
