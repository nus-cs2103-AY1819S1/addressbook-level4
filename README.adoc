* SocialCare is a social welfare event and volunteer management system. It is a desktop application and  has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is *written in OOP fashion*, and is morphed from the https://se-edu.github.io/docs/Team.html[se-edu] team's https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[Address Book - Level 4], which provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* This application is intended for social welfare organisations that want to better manage their volunteers & events, and export volunteer certificates.
* SocialCare allows users to:
** Manage contacts and events faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.
** Use tags to categorize events and volunteers.
** Manage additional volunteer data, such as number of service hours per volunteer.
** Export volunteer certificates detailing each volunteer's involvement in the organisation's events.
