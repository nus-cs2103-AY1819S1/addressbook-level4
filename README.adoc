== About

* This is a module planner application.

* It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* It allows a user to keep track of past modules, and list possible future modules based
  on the user’s academic requirements (for graduation, a minor etc).

* The target users for this product are Computer Science and Computer Engineering undergraduate students
  in the National University of Singapore (NUS).

* What this product does is to simplify the module planning process that every NUS student has to go through.

'''

==== Current way of planning modules

****
1. Go to an external site to check what modules one has to take.
2. See which modules' pre-requisites have been fulfilled and are open for one to take.
3. Choose some of those modules.
4. Start planning for the next semester.
5. Repeat (1) - (4) for any number of semesters.
6. Wishes to remove some modules.
7. Some modules planned now have their pre-requisites unfulfilled.
8. Sighs in frustration.
9. Repeat (8).
****

So *tedious*.

==== New way of planning modules

****
1. Input academic requirements.
2. Application lists possible modules to take based on academic commitments and module prerequisites.
3. Choose some of those modules.
4. Repeat (1) - (3) for any number of semesters.
5. Wishes to remove some modules.
6. Application removes modules which pre-requisites are not fulfilled and suggests new modules to take.
****

Much better!
