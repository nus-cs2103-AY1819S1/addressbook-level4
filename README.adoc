== Introduction

LearnVocuabulary (LV) is a desktop application for people who prefer to use an offline version of the dictionary for learning purposes. More importantly, LV is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). With LV you can make digital flash-cards of words you find troublesome, and discard them only after you have memorized the meaning.
LV can fetch the words faster than searching it on the website. Interested? Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!
