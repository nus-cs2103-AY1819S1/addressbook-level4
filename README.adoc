* This is a desktop Event Organiser application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is targeted at NUS students.
* It allows users to store their own personal particulars and organise events and for other users to join the event as event participants.
* The event organiser can create polls to gather opinions about the event time, date and location and get participants to vote.
* It allows users to input their weekly schedule via NUSMODs and connect users through friendships to facilitate the organisation of events.
* Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI and Appveyor CI.
