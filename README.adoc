* This is a desktop meeting scheduling application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* The base code is taken from [Address Book (level 4)](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1617S1/addressbook-level4). Below are some description about Address Book (level 4):
** It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
** It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
