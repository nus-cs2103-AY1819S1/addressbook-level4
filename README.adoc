* This is a desktop social welfare event and volunteer management application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. It provides a *reasonably well-written* code example that is *significantly bigger* (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
* The target audience is social welfare organisations that want to better manage their volunteers & events, and gain further statistical insights from the data.
** Manage contacts and events faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
** Use tags to categorize events and volunteers
** Support more fields for volunteers, such as number of volunteer hours
** View volunteer and event statistics and derive insights from them
