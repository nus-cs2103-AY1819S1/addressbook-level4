* This is a desktop Schedule Manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application written by developers of F11-4, to target small to mid-size study/interest groups in NUS.
* What's different from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Address Book level 4]:
** More specific functions added
** More test cases, including automated GUI testing.
