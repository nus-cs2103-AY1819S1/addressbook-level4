= Picconso: The Console-based Image Editor

ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:relfileprefix: docs/]

Picconso is an CLI (Command Line Interface) Image Editor designed and developed for quick and efficient image-editing. Many image-editors are complex and difficult to pick up, having a steep learning curve and sometimes even a steep price! +

Unlike them, Picconso offers the same features, in a much more simplified manner. With Picconso, all traditional image-editing features can be performed solely through text commands, removing the hassle of working with a mouse. The interface can be used by
photographers, designers, developers and more, and is very easy to pick up.
