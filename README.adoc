SuperTA is a desktop management application made for TAs to keep track on students progress and attendance. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

With just a few simple commands, you can

* Search for student records
* take and track attendance of each student
* record and view feedback for each student
* and many more.
